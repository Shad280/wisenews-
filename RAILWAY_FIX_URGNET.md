# 🚨 CRITICAL RAILWAY CONFIGURATION FIX NEEDED

## ❌ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

Your Railway "Custom Start Command" is set to:
```
python app.py
```

But it should be empty (to use Procfile) or set to:
```
gunicorn app:app
```

## 🔧 **HOW TO FIX:**

### **Method 1: Remove Custom Start Command (Recommended)**
1. 🚂 Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. 📱 Click your WiseNews project
3. ⚙️ Go to Settings → Deploy section
4. 🗑️ **DELETE** the "Custom Start Command" (leave it empty)
5. 💾 Save changes
6. 🔄 Railway will redeploy using your Procfile: `web: gunicorn app:app`

### **Method 2: Fix the Start Command**
1. Change "Custom Start Command" from `python app.py` to:
```
gunicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## 🎯 **WHY THIS FIXES IT:**

- ❌ `python app.py` runs Flask dev server (not production-ready)
- ✅ `gunicorn app:app` runs proper WSGI server for Railway
- 🔧 Procfile is designed for this: `web: gunicorn app:app`

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

1. **Delete the Custom Start Command** in Railway settings
2. **Let Railway use the Procfile** we already fixed
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for redeployment
4. **Try your URL again**: https://web-production-1f6d.up.railway.app/

## 🎉 **EXPECTED RESULT:**

You should see **WiseNews homepage** instead of Railway ASCII art!
