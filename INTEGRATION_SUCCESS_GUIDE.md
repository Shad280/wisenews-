🚀 HOW TO START:
================

Method 1: Enhanced Features (Recommended)
-----------------------------------------
python app.py

This will start WiseNews with:
- Real-time WebSocket connections
- Enhanced live events features
- Performance monitoring
- All new capabilities

Method 2: Fallback Mode
----------------------
If enhanced features fail to load, the app automatically falls back to basic functionality.

🌐 ACCESS YOUR ENHANCED LIVE EVENTS:
====================================

1. Start the application: python app.py
2. Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Login to your account
4. Navigate to: Live Events
5. Experience real-time updates!

🔍 TESTING CHECKLIST:
=====================

□ App starts without errors
□ WebSocket connection established
□ Live events page loads
□ Real-time updates working
□ Subscribe/unsubscribe functions
□ Notifications appear instantly
□ Mobile interface responsive
□ Performance metrics visible

📈 MONITORING:
==============

View enhanced metrics at:
- /api/live-events/performance
- /api/live-events/websocket-status
- /api/live-events/connection-stats

🎯 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
=========================

For production scaling:
1. Configure Redis for multi-server support
2. Set up WebSocket load balancing (nginx)
3. Enable SSL/TLS for wss:// connections
4. Monitor connection limits
5. Set up alerts for performance metrics

🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:
===================

If WebSocket features don't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all dependencies installed
3. Check firewall settings for WebSocket
4. App will fallback to basic mode automatically

Enhanced features detect issues automatically and gracefully degrade to ensure your news system always works.
