# 🆘 Railway Emergency Troubleshooting Guide

## If WiseNews Still Won't Load After 15 Minutes

### 🔧 **Emergency Actions:**

1. **Install Railway CLI for Live Logs:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Force Complete Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Railway redeploy"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check Railway Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Click your WiseNews project
   - Check "Deployments" tab for errors

### 📋 **What to Look For in Logs:**

- ✅ **Good signs:** "Starting gunicorn", "Database initialized", "WiseNews starting"
- ❌ **Bad signs:** "ImportError", "ModuleNotFoundError", "Port already in use"

### 🛠️ **Common Issues & Quick Fixes:**

1. **Memory Limit Exceeded:**
   - Railway free tier has memory limits
   - Solution: Optimize app or upgrade Railway plan

2. **Port Binding Issues:**
   - App not listening on Railway's PORT
   - ✅ Already fixed: app uses `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)`

3. **Database Permission Issues:**
   - SQLite file permissions
   - ✅ Should auto-resolve on Railway

4. **Import/Dependency Issues:**
   - Missing packages in requirements.txt
   - ✅ Already verified: all packages present

### 🚀 **Alternative Quick Test:**

Create a minimal test version:
```python
# test_app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return '<h1>WiseNews Test - Railway Working!</h1>'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import os
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

### 📞 **Get Help:**

If nothing works:
1. Share Railway deployment logs
2. Check Railway status page: https://status.railway.app/
