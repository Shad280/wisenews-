# 🚀 WiseNews Railway Deployment - STEP BY STEP

## You're at Railway's "New Project" page - HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT TO DO:

### **OPTION 1: If you see "Upload Files" or "Local Files"**
1. Click **"Upload files"** or **"Local files"**
2. Upload your deployment folder contents
3. Deploy!

### **OPTION 2: If only GitHub options are shown**
1. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. Look for **"Upload files instead"** or **"Local deployment"**
3. Or try clicking your profile/settings to find file upload

### **OPTION 3: Use GitHub (Quick Setup)**
1. Go to **github.com** in a new tab
2. Create new repository called "wisenews-app"
3. Upload your deployment files there
4. Come back to Railway and connect that repo

### **OPTION 4: Use Railway CLI (Fastest)**
1. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. Look for **"Railway CLI"** option
3. Or go to railway.app/cli for CLI instructions

## 📁 **Files Ready to Upload:**
From your `c:\Users\Stamo\news scrapper\deployment` folder:
- ✅ app_minimal.py
- ✅ requirements_minimal.txt  
- ✅ Procfile
- ✅ runtime.txt
- ✅ templates/ folder

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**
Once files are uploaded, Railway will:
1. ✅ Detect Python app automatically
2. ✅ Install dependencies from requirements_minimal.txt
3. ✅ Start app using Procfile command
4. ✅ Give you a live URL!

## 📞 **Tell me what you see next:**
- What options appear after clicking "Deploy from GitHub repo"?

Your app is ready to deploy - we just need to get the files uploaded! 🚀
