Ghanaâ€™s inflation rate fell more than expected in July, bolstering the case for further interest-rate cuts.
Annual inflation slowed to 12.1% in July, compared with 13.7% in the previous month, Government Statistician Alhassan Iddrisu told reporters in the capital, Accra, on Wednesday. The median estimate of five economists in a Bloomberg survey was 12.4%. Prices rose 0.7% in the month, he said.
