Uber Technologies Inc. announced $20 billion in new stock buybacks after sharing a better-than-expected third-quarter forecast and quarterly results, suggesting that growth at its core rideshare and delivery units still has room to pick up steam.
Gross bookings — which include ride hails, delivery orders and driver and merchant earnings but not tips — will range from $48.25 billion to $49.75 billion for the three months ending September, Uber said in a statement Wednesday. Wall Street was projecting $47.6 billion, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.
