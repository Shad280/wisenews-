Elderly man can be released early because of time already served in custody, with judge saying case calls for tempering ‘justice with mercy’
An elderly Hong Kong man has been jailed for four years and eight months for strangling his daughter to death three years ago after being provoked into committing the act.
The High Court on Wednesday sentenced security guard Chan Kwai-sang to a term close to the period he had spent in custody, allowing for his early release.
The defendant will be eligible for early release on grounds of his industry and good conduct during his three years and five months in custody, but subject to the prison service’s discretion and a legal provision that requires the defendant to spend an additional 31 days behind bars.
Earlier this year, a seven-member jury cleared the 74-year-old of murdering his daughter, Chan Hang-sze, but convicted him of the lesser charge of manslaughter on the basis of her provocation.
The trial heard the defendant had frequent quarrels with his 32-year-old daughter and ex-wife over trivial matters when they lived together in a flat in Mong Kok’s Hoi Fu Court in the lead-up to the killing on March 7, 2022.
The defendant said his jobless daughter, who had autism and bipolar disorder, had prevented him from going to the toilet in the early hours that day, forcing him to urinate in the kitchen instead.
