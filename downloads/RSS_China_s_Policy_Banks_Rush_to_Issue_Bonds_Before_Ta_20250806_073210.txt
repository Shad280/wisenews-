Chinaâ€™s policy banks have embarked on a bond-issuance spree in an effort to lock in lower yields before the reinstatement of a value-added tax on interest income later this week.
Agricultural Development Bank of China is offering four notes with maturities of up to 10 years, while Export-Import Bank of China will price two securities with the longest due in February 2031. That marks the busiest day of new issuance since 2012 by the policy banks, lenders set up by the government to promote its policy objectives, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.
