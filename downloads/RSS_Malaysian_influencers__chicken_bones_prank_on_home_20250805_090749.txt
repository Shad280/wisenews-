A video of the content creators showing them offering the bones to the man after eating at a KFC restaurant has ignited public anger
The video, in Mandarin and originally uploaded on social media, shows the trio eating fried chicken at a KFC restaurant.
The giggling trio then wrap up the chicken bones with rice, saying “don’t waste food” and film themselves offering the food waste to a sleeping homeless man.
As his reaction turns from delight to misery after discovering the paltry offer, the content creators give a thumbs up.
The video has stirred an immediate backlash, with the trio accused of “rage baiting” by creating appalling content to drive engagement on their accounts.
The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said on Tuesday that the video was “exploitation of the marginalised in the name of cheap entertainment”, which has caused public grievances.
“The dissemination of content that degrades or insults the dignity of individuals is not only unethical, but also leads to the normalisation of inhumane culture in society,” it added.
