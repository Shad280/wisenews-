Customised, affordable and inclusive medical aid is coming.
Medical aid shouldnât come with a one-size-fits-all label. Because your needs arenât the same as your neighbourâs. Or your cousinâs. Or your bossâs.
Letâs be honest â when you signed up for your current medical aid, how well did you really understand the fine print and limitations?
Not just a tweak here or there, but meaningful changes that reflect how modern South Africans live and what they truly need from a medical aid scheme?
Launching on 1 October, a bold new medical aid scheme will rise. Built on Fedhealth's 89-year legacy of innovation and backed by the power of Sanlam, this new scheme is designed to deliver exactly what you've been asking for.
