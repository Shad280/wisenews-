The collaboration will leverage Alibaba research arm Damo Academy’s medical AI screening system, called ‘One Sweep Multi-Check’
“We look forward to working with Damo Academy to drive the health management gateway for cancer and chronic diseases ever forward with cutting-edge AI screening technology,” BJU president Pan Zhongying said in the statement. She pointed out that the AI-based screening system would “provide more efficient, reliable and people-centred healthcare”.
The collaboration with BJU – a full-service, internationally accredited healthcare provider – showed how far Alibaba’s research arm has bolstered the credentials of its AI-powered cancer detection tools.
