It marked the largest single-day inflow since April 9, when HK$35.6 billion of net buying was recorded, according to data compiled by Wind. On July 25, net purchases also topped HK$20 billion.
So far this year, net purchases through the southbound link have totalled more than HK$884.4 billion, according to exchange data, surpassing the full-year total for 2024 and reaching an all-time record.
“The southbound inflows actually serve as one of the most important drivers of the Hong Kong equity market,” said Kenny Tang, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Financial Analysts. “Supportive national policies are clearly aimed at revitalising the market and lifting valuations, which in turn help attract foreign capital.”
“With market capitalisation now exceeding HK$40 trillion, global and index funds are increasingly required to hold Hong Kong stocks,” Tang said. “This broader participation, along with a policy push to expand the market and facilitate more IPOs – especially for Chinese firms returning from the US – could further boost international interest.”
