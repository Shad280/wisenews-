An elderly man has been arrested in Hong Kong for allegedly assaulting a bus driver after a dispute on a double-decker vehicle.
A police spokesman said on Tuesday that the force had received a report the day before in which a 25-year-old driver accused a passenger of physically assaulting him on Argyle Street, Kowloon City.
“During the scuffle, the 25-year-old bus driver was physically attacked by the [passenger]. The man had also thrown [the driver’s] phone onto the ground. The attacker had fled,” the force said.
The bus driver sustained injuries to his face and limbs, and was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei for treatment.
Officers from the Kowloon City police district had reviewed surveillance footage from the force’s newly installed SmartView CCTVs to locate the attacker. A 68-year-old man was arrested for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage.
The man remained under police custody as of Tuesday afternoon.
