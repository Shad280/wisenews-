A Destinus Hornet 30 autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle at the Paris Air Show in June.
Destinus, a drone startup that supplies weapons to Ukraine, is planning to buy a Swiss company that develops autopilot systems for aviation for 180 million Swiss francs ($223 million) in cash and stock.
The deal for Zurich-based Daedalean will boost Destinusâ€™s artificial intelligence capabilities as it develops strike drones and hypersonic aircraft, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. They expect the transaction to close by the end of year.
