OpenAI:
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman
OpenAI is in early talks about a potential sale of stock for current and former employees at a valuation of about $500 billion, people briefed on the investment discussions said, marking an enormous gain in value for the artificial intelligence leader.
The company is targeting a secondary stock sale in the billions of dollars, the people said, asking to remain anonymous because they werenâ€™t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Existing investors including Thrive Capital have approached OpenAI about buying some of the employee shares, the people said.
