In the version of the article initially published, in Extended Data Fig. 5, the volcano plot in C4 was identical to that in C1 due to a copy-paste error in figure assembly. C4 has now been updated with the correct plot in the HTML and PDF versions of the article. The error had no effect on the conclusions of the figure or the paper. The raw data are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/16116254.
