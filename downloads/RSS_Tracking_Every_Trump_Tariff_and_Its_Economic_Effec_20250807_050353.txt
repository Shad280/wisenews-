President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs went into effect Aug. 7, four months after he first announced nation-by-nation rates and a week after he announced a slew of new levies. A global minimum duty of 10% has been put in place, as well as higher rates for select trading partners.
In the hours before the midnight effective time, he also signed an executive order adding an additional 25% tariff on India over its purchase of Russian energy, set to go into effect within the next three weeks. Switzerland will be hit with one of the highest rates, 39%, despite efforts from Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter, who rushed to Washington earlier this week to try to renegotiate.
Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and cars are based on so-called Section 232 investigations into the national-security implications of imports in critical sectors. There are ongoing investigations that could lay the foundation for such tariffs to be imposed on additional sectors: semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, heavy trucks and commercial aircraft and engines.
The president is hoping that his tariffs will help protect US jobs and encourage companies to invest more in the country, ​​as well as raise government revenue. But many economists say the tariffs will hurt growth as higher prices for goods put a squeeze on household budgets.
Here’s a compilation of measures both implemented and planned, accompanied by a Bloomberg Economics view on the effect.

Note: non-USMCA compliant goods for Mexico and Canada are assumed to be all dutiable imports in 2024, excluding Canadian crude oil. Steel and aluminum are per published tariff product lists, and effective 2024 tariffs are used to calculate the impact of removing exemptions; Autos are from pre-publication tariff product list. For threats, we assume a 25% tariff rate and use the exclusions list from the ‘reciprocal’ tariff executive order: pharmaceuticals are all HS-29 and HS-30; semi-conductors are all HS-85; and other sectors are all HS-74 (Copper) and HS-44 (Lumber and Timber).
