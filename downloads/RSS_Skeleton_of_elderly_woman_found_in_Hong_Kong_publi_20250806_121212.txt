Police and Housing Department officers discover corpse of 77-year-old at Kwai Shing East Estate during visit to execute months-old eviction order
The skeletal remains of an elderly woman have been discovered in a Hong Kong public rental flat, the second such case in three months.
The situation came to light at 10am on Wednesday when officers from the Housing Department visited the home of the 77-year-old at Shing Yat House in Kwai Shing East Estate to execute an eviction after the order had apparently been ignored for months.
A police source said the force found no signs of foul play and contacted the woman’s two sons.
Investigators reportedly found sales receipts in the flat dating back to November 2023, with none bearing later dates.
It was understood that the deceased, who had suffered from depression for more than 20 years, had previously been the subject of an investigation under the department’s “well-off tenants” policy, which requires public housing residents whose income or assets exceed certain limits to either pay higher rents or move out.
In October last year, the department issued a notice asking her to explain the origins of certain assets, but she did not respond, the source said.
