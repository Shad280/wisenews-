Key Points
Match Group (MTCH -0.22%), a leading provider of online dating products and services including Tinder and Hinge, released its second quarter results on August 5, 2025. The earnings showed GAAP revenue of $864 million, exactly flat with the prior year's quarter but $9.92 million, or 1.16%, ahead of consensus estimates (GAAP). GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.49, precisely matching analyst expectations. Management highlighted continued progress in its turnaround strategy, notably strong growth at Hinge, but the quarter also reflected ongoing declines in Tinder payers and margins. Overall, the quarter gave evidence of positive momentum in product innovation but showed lingering challenges around user trends and profitability.

Match Group operates a diverse portfolio of online dating platforms, serving a wide range of users across global markets. Its most prominent brands include Tinder, designed for casual connections, and Hinge, which targets relationship-minded users. Other brands—such as Match, Azar, and The League—add geographical and demographic breadth.
Success for the company has centered around three focus areas: brand portfolio strategy, technological innovation, and user safety. Differentiated brands allow for targeted user experiences, while ongoing investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and trust features aim to keep users engaged. Management consistently highlights safety and compliance, given the sensitive nature of user information.
Match Group delivered GAAP revenue slightly ahead of expectations, while profitability metrics declined from the previous year. Adjusted operating income stood at $290 million, down 5%. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) increased almost 7% to $409 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, highlighting strong financial discipline.
Tinder, the group’s largest revenue driver and a product focused on social discovery, continued to show a decrease in both monthly active users and payers. Specifically, total payers across the company dropped to 14.1 million, down 5% year-over-year. However, spending per paying user (RPP) rose 5% year-over-year, indicating that the company is increasing user monetization despite shrinking volume.
Revenue in this segment grew 25% year-over-year, driven by a nearly 20% increase in global monthly active users and a 60% rise in users in European expansion markets. The platform also saw a 15% boost in contacts and matches due to its new AI-powered Core Discovery Algorithm, which debuted in March 2025.
Technological innovation featured prominently, with significant reinvestment in AI capabilities. Tinder rolled out new features including AI-enabled Discovery and a redesigned Recommendations engine. At the same time, user trust remained a critical priority, reflected in expanded rollout of Face Check verification across Tinder and enhancements in AI-based bot detection.
Across the group, cost reductions were underway—Match Group reported $100 million in annualized savings, with $50 million of that being reinvested in further product and market expansion, especially at Tinder and Hinge, in the second half of 2025. The company also continued returning capital to shareholders, repurchasing 13.7 million shares year to date through June 30, 2025, for $420 million and paying out $95 million in dividends.
Management offered clear forward guidance for Q3 2025, expecting total revenue of $910 million to $920 million, a projected rise of 2% to 3%, and adjusted operating income of $330 million to $335 million, representing a 3% decline. For FY2025, targets remain for revenue of $3.375 to $3.5 billion and an adjusted operating income margin of roughly 36.5%, excluding restructuring costs. These projections do not factor in any potential gains from ongoing efforts to reduce Apple App Store payment fees, although management did note the possibility for future upside.
The main area for investors to watch remains Tinder’s user trends and the group's overall ability to grow its base of payers. While Hinge continues to deliver strong organic growth, flat total revenue and shrinking margins at the group level put pressure on longer-term expansion. Technology differentiation is a moving target, with competitors ramping up their own AI features. As Match Group progresses through its transformation strategy and global expansions, the effectiveness of its product innovation and trust initiatives will be critical.
MTCH currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
