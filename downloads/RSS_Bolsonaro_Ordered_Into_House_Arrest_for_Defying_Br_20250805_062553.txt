Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro
Jair Bolsonaro was ordered into house arrest Monday by a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who said the former president had violated a social media ban for the second time while awaiting trial on an alleged coup attempt.
The order from Justice Alexandre de Moraes is the latest volley in a battle that has quickly intensified since Donald Trump threatened 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods and placed sanctions on the judge due to the case against Bolsonaro.
