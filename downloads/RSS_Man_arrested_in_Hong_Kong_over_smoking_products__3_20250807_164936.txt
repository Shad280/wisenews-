Authorities seized HK$12 million of illegal items, including ketamine from passenger who flew to city from the Netherlands
Hong Kong customs officers have arrested a man who flew in from the Netherlands after 30kg (66lbs) of suspected ketamine and smoking products worth about HK$12 million (US$152,870) were found in his luggage.
The 37-year-old man arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday on a flight from Amsterdam.
During clearance, officers from the Customs and Excise Department discovered what they believed were 30kg of ketamine, nine boxes of nicotine pouches containing Part I poison nicotine, and four alternative smoking products in his two checked bags.
The man was immediately arrested and placed under investigation.
Customs on Thursday urged the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary reward.
Do not accept an offer or task to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong, and refrain from carrying unknown items for other people, authorities said.
