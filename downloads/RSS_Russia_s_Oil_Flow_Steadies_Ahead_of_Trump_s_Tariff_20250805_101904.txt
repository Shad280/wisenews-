Moscow’s biggest crude-buyer India faces punitive levies on goods exported to US
Russia shipped 3.15 million barrels a day of crude in the four weeks to August 3.
Russia’s oil shipments are yet to show clear signs of being hit by US President Donald Trump’s threat to “substantially” hike tariffs on imports from India, the biggest buyer of Moscow’s seaborne crude.
Four-week average crude shipments edged lower for a second week in the latest data, while seven-day flows rebounded. Seaborne cargoes averaged 3.15 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Aug. 3, down by about 2% from the period to July 27, tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.
