Narendra Modi has been urging Indians to buy local goods to offset any slump in global demand.
India’s government is scrambling to contain the economic fallout from President Donald Trump’s threatened tariff action, which has left officials in New Delhi reeling on how to respond.
Trump’s latest tirade caught officials in India’s capital off guard. The president’s language — calling India’s economy “dead,” its tariff barriers “obnoxious” and saying India is indifferent to the plight of Ukrainians — has been very atypical and akin to a verbal slap in the face, an official in New Delhi said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. Officials have no template to deal with these kinds of public assaults, the person said, adding that the latest turn of events has put a strain on India’s relationship with the US.
