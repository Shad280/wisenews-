The financial information and academic performance of Columbia University students and alumni were stolen in a recent breach, according to a Bloomberg News review of some of the pilfered data.
The data includes bank account and routing numbers, student loan and scholarship disbursements, standardized test scores, grade-point averages, class schedules, home addresses and other contact information, a Bloomberg review of 53.6 gigabytes of the stolen files shows. Nine current and former students who began attending Columbia undergraduate and graduate programs as early as the 1990s confirmed the accuracy of their data in the files. Bloomberg couldnâ€™t verify the entire cache.
