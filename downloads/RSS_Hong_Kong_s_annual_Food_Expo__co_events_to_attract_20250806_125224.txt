Trade Development Council, events’ organiser, says about 1,890 exhibitors to join five fairs, including more than 700 for Food Expo
Hong Kong’s annual Food Expo and four other events have attracted 50 more new exhibitors this year, including vendors from Brazil, Mongolia and Zimbabwe, and will offer products at prices as low as HK$35 (US$4.46) to celebrate its 35th anniversary.
The Trade Development Council, the organiser of the events, said on Wednesday that about 1,890 exhibitors were joining the five fairs, an increase of 50 from last year. The Food Expo alone is set to bring in more than 700 vendors.
The five fairs will bring together exhibitors from 35 countries and regions, including first-time participants from Brazil, Mongolia and Zimbabwe.
The events will also feature 45 regional pavilions, an uptick from last year, showcasing products from Macau, Japan, Thailand, Kenya, Poland and mainland Chinese provinces.
All the events will be held at Wan Chai’s Convention and Exhibition Centre.
The Food Expo, Beauty and Wellness Expo, and Home Delights Expo will run from August 14 to 18, while the Food Expo Pro, a branch of the food event, and the International Tea Fair will start at the same time but finish two days earlier than the rest.
