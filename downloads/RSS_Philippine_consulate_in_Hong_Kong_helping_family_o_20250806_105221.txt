Cabby was 80, prompting lawmaker to renew calls for tightening health requirements for elderly taxi drivers
The Philippine consulate in Hong Kong has offered help to the family of a Filipino tourist who was killed when an 80-year-old taxi driver crashed his vehicle into a hotel wall, as a lawmaker renewed calls for tightening health requirements for elderly cabbies.
In an email to the Post on Wednesday, Philippine vice-consul George Mariano Soriano said his office was assisting the family of the 35-year-old tourist and “anticipating their arrival in Hong Kong soon to arrange the shipment of remains”.
“The consulate general offers its deepest condolences to the deceased’s family and prays for his eternal rest,” he said.
According to Soriano, the body is now in Kwai Chung Public Mortuary.
On Tuesday afternoon, the tourist was struck head-on by the speeding taxi, which mounted the pavement at Nina Hotel in Tsuen Wan. The impact of the crash left a hole in the facade of the hotel.
The victim was rushed to hospital but was later pronounced dead.
