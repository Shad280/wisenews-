BP Plc achieved a stronger oil-trading performance than its rivals during a volatile second quarter by sticking to shorter-duration trades.
As President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and a war in the Middle East roiled global markets, BP relied on its own analytics to track global crude flows “as opposed to the macro headlines,” Chief Executive Officer Murray Auchincloss said on Tuesday. Reducing the duration of its trades helped the London-based energy giant to navigate wild price swings, he said.
