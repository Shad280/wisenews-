Indonesia’s economic growth unexpectedly accelerated in the second quarter, with resilient consumption and strong exports easing pressure on policymakers grappling with uncertainty from the rollout of US tariffs.
Gross domestic product in the three months through June rose 5.12% from a year ago, the nation’s statistics office announced on Tuesday. That beat the 4.8% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The economy expanded 4.04% on a quarterly basis, more than the 3.69% expansion forecast by economists.
