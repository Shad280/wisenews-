Bank of Japan watchers brought forward their forecast for when they expect the country’s next interest rate hike, after clarity over trade increased with US President Donald Trump announcing deals including one with Japan.
Some 42% of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate the move in October, jumping from 32% in the previousBloomberg Terminal survey. Analyst views were last canvassed before the announcement of Japan’s trade pact with the US on July 22, and last week’s BOJ policy decision. Those predicting it in January slightly dropped to a third, while those expecting December doubled to 11%.
