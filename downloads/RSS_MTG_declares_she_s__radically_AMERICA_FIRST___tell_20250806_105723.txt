A former Voice of America employee is charged with making repeated death threats against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and her family.
Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia asserted that she is "radically AMERICA FIRST," shaming those who are not and labeling them as "the enemy."
The congresswoman said that the nation is "falling apart."
"I’m America First. Maybe even America only. I don’t care if you call me an isolationist. America is our home. And it’s falling apart," she wrote on social media.

"When my children’s generation are buried in credit card debt, student loan debt, can’t afford rent, can’t afford car insurance, health insurance, and feel like they will never be able to afford to buy a home, Yes. I’m unapologetically and radically AMERICA FIRST. AND SHAME ON EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS NOT. As a matter of fact YOU are the problem. YOU are the enemy. As a mother, I can’t see it any other way," she declared.
Greene has been expressing frustration with the GOP.
