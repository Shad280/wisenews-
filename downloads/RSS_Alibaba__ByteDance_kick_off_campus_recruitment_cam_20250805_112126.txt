Campus recruitments have become routine for Big Tech firms as they answer Beijing’s call to help create jobs for young graduates
Chinese tech giants Alibaba Group Holding and ByteDance are targeting fresh graduates in separate recruitment campaigns, a sign of their confidence in future growth driven by AI adoption.
Taobao and Tmall Group, Alibaba’s e-commerce unit, kicked off its global recruitment campaign on Tuesday, offering an unspecified number of roles to students who were due to graduate between November 2025 and October 2026.
According to the job posting, half of the roles would be related to artificial intelligence, as the group promised to spend more resources on training “algorithm and AI talent”. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.
Separately, TikTok and Douyin owner ByteDance was offering 5,000 jobs to fresh graduates as part of its 2026 campus recruitment campaign.
According to the ByteDance job posting, students who finish their studies between September 2025 and August 2026 could apply for “research and development” roles, marking a 23 per cent increase from last year’s campus recruitment figure, while the number of “product” jobs available would double.
