Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is using a familiar strategy to stay in Donald Trump’s good graces: expanding existing initiatives to show he supports the president’s “Made in the USA” agenda.
Standing in the Oval Office on Wednesday between Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Cook announced that Apple will increase its US investment commitment to $600 billion over four years — up from the $500 billion pledged after Trump’s second-term victory.
