Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has discovered a possible leak of trade secrets related to its advanced chipmaking techniques, and has taken action against staff deemed responsible.
The chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. has initiated legal proceedings, TSMC said in a statement without elaborating. On Tuesday, the Nikkei reported that TSMC had fired several employees suspected of attempting to obtain critical proprietary information on 2-nanometer chip development. That next-generation semiconductor process is entering mass production in the second half of this year, and will eventually power a plethora of devices from smartphones to AI accelerators.
