South Korean stocks rose the most in Asia on Monday as opposition to a plan to hike tax on capital gains intensified.
The benchmark Kospi climbed as much as 1.1%, rebounding after Friday’s slump, as a petition to withdraw the tax hike proposal announced late Thursday received more than 120,000 signatures. In a sign that the pushback is gaining traction, the ruling party floated a possible revision, while President Lee Jae Myung’s office said there’s a need to study the underlying causes of the market decline.
