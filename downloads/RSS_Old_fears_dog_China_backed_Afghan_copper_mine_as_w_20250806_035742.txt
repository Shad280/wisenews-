Taliban rulers value ‘demonstrative effect’ of project but have yet to make good on security or governance pledges, observer in China says
State-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) recently announced that it was making significant progress toward starting copper extraction this year in the Mes Aynak Mine in central Afghanistan’s Logar province, home to one of the world’s largest untouched copper deposits.
According to Afghan media outlet Tolo News, MCC representative Deng Guoping said the company was ready to start production this year “if the follow-up procedures with the government go smoothly”.
The Mes Aynak project was awarded to MCC under a 30-year contract in 2008 but was delayed due to security challenges, the presence of archaeological remains dating back to the Bronze Age and landmines from decades of war, and the lack of infrastructure, according to the company.
Last year, the Taliban announced a switch from open-pit mining at Mes Aynak to underground mining, a costlier process that is seen as more protective of archaeological sites. Officials further emphasised that the mine would work to avoid damage to relics, according to The Art Newspaper.
