Trump’s Tariffs:
With the hours ticking down before President Donald Trump’s global tariffs kick in Thursday, the Swiss government is scrambling win a reprieve from Washington after last week’s shock announcement of 39% duties on the European country’s exports.
President and Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter is traveling to Washington on Tuesday, the government announced. The trip — presumably to see if a deal can be salvaged or an extension granted for more negotiations — comes after an emergency meeting of the governing Federal Council on Monday to discuss options.
