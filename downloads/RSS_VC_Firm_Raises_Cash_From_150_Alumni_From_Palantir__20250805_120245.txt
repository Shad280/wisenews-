A VC firm called Forward Deployed Venture Capital has raised a $45 million defense and security fund from some of Silicon Valley’s newly wealthy — winning checks from 150 current and former employees of tech companies like Palantir Technologies Inc., Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Anduril Industries Inc.
The three-year-old firm, started by general partner Mark Scianna, also pulled in backing from institutional sources like Bain Capital Ventures for the $45 million fund. But Scianna, a former Palantir staffer, did much of his fundraising from individuals and former colleagues.
