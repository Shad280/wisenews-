Images circulating on social media have prompted theories about the plane ranging from a carrier-based fighter to a ‘loyal wingman’ drone
At least two photographs of the aircraft, taken from various angles on the ground, have been circulating since Monday. It is not clear from the pictures whether the plane had a cockpit or internal weapons bay.
The images reveal a slimmer fuselage and smaller size compared with images of another plane thought to be the J-36 stealth fighter, suggesting that the new aircraft might have a higher top speed.
Some military analysts suggested it could be China’s third distinct sixth-generation stealth combat aircraft, with the J-36 already believed to be nearly ready for pre-production testing.
Some analysis, including the US-based website The War Zone argued that its streamlined design and lack of the features typical of piloted fighters suggested it may indeed be a drone optimised strictly for stealth rather than manoeuvrability.
Andreas Rupprecht, an aviation analyst, wrote on social media that its shape – a lambda-wing layout reminiscent of the J-50, another Chinese stealth fighter under development – suggested it might be the design for a collaborative combat aircraft.
