Pfizer Inc. raised its profit forecast for the year as the drugmakerâ€™s ongoing cost cuts helped make up for a lack of sales growth.
Adjusted profits will be between $2.90 to $3.10 per share in 2025, the New York-based company said in a statement Tuesday. Pfizer had previously expected adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $3 per share. The company maintained its revenue projections of between $61 billion and $64 billion for the year.
