Motorists have been warned about a straightforward "age limit" regulation in supermarket car parks, which impacts major UK retailers such as Aldi, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.
Parent and child spaces are installed in most supermarket car parks, providing additional room for families to navigate and pack their cars. These spots are typically positioned near the entrance, offering users convenient access to the store without lengthy walks.
Nevertheless, the regulations are frequently unclear, with numerous shops failing to display obvious signage clarifying who is permitted to use these coveted spaces. It comes after UK drivers were warned over 'avoiding' road instead of having to follow new rule.
Specialists are now cautioning that drivers could face penalties if they violate the lesser-known "age limit" regulation, reports the Express. Professionals at EMG Motor Group stated that the rules were "fairly simple" to grasp, with spaces only accessible to parents or guardians accompanying a child under 12 into the store.
The threshold is established at 12 because this is when children no longer need car seats or restraints while in the passenger seat. While there is no strict legislation, motorists could face a substantial £100 penalty in the event of a disastrous conclusion to their shopping excursion.
Specialists at EMG Motor Group clarified: "No, there is no law against parking in a parent and child parking space without a child under 12 with you, but you are risking a PCN (Parking Charge Notice), the same as if you incorrectly used a disabled parking bay."
The reason behind the strict enforcement of parking rules in certain car parks, often leading to fines of up to £100, is that they are typically under private ownership, such as those belonging to supermarkets, which operate under their Accredited Trade Association (ATA) status.
"This is because the car parks are usually owned privately, for example, by supermarkets, and so they enforce rules allowed by their Accredited Trade Association (ATA) status," they said.
For motorists puzzled by the regulations of a specific car park, it's advisable to get clarity from the related store or venue to avoid the risk of receiving a hefty fine.
The experts added: "If you're confused as to the rules in a particular car park, it's worth checking with the store or destination that you're parking at, so that you don't risk a fine, which could be up to £100, being slapped on your windscreen."
Yet, ambiguity remains over whether pregnant women are entitled to use parent-child parking bays, which offer additional space. Officials at the RAC have clarified the intended use of these bays: "Parent and child bays are reserved for parents or guardians with one or more children under 12 years old."
However, the eligibility of expectant mothers to utilise these spaces is not well-defined, prompting the RAC to suggest that the best course of action is to inquire directly with individual store managers about their specific policies. "It's unclear whether pregnant women can use the spaces and probably best to ask an individual store manager what their rules are," they shared.
