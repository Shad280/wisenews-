As a nationalist outsider is sworn in as head of state, a clash of two very different politicians with two very different visions for Poland lies ahead.
Karol Nawrocki departs from the Presidential Palace in Warsaw on June 3.
Donald Tusk returned to power in Poland to great anticipation at home and among European Union allies a little over 18 months ago. Now another awkward cohabitation between the prime minister and head of state threatens to create more obstacles for his struggling government.
Karol Nawrocki, the nationalist outsider who scored a shock victory in June’s runoff for president, will be inaugurated on Wednesday, setting up a battle with Tusk’s pro-EU administration. Instead of securing a long-awaited ally, the government is now preparing for an opponent in the presidential palace again.
