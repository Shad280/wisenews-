The Fed:
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is emerging as a top candidate to serve as the central bank’s chair among President Donald Trump’s advisers as they look for a replacement for Jerome Powell, according to people familiar with the matter.
Trump advisers are impressed with Waller’s willingness to move on policy based on forecasting, rather than current data, and his deep knowledge of the Fed system as a whole, the people said. Waller has met with the president’s team about the role, but has yet to meet with Trump himself, the people said on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
