After adding more than $65 billion in market value over the past four months, the fate of SoftBank Group Corp. shares is more firmly attached to the global artificial intelligence boom than ever before.
Investors are returning to Masayoshi Son’s flagship company thanks to its key position in Donald Trump’s AI strategy, stake in OpenAI and growing holdings in major names such as Nvidia Corp.
