Indonesian police have detained the co-founder of eFishery Pte, investigating a startup whose collapse shook up Southeast Asia’s investment and tech community.
Gibran Huzaifah was detained last week by the white-collar crimes division, the police said. He and two other former eFishery executives have remained in custody since July 31, according to a text message from Helfi Assegaf, director of special economic crimes at the National Police’s Criminal Investigation Agency.
