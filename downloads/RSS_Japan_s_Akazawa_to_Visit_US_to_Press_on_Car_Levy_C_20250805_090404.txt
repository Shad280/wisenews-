Trump’s Tariffs:
Japan’s top trade negotiator is set to leave for the US on Tuesday as Tokyo aims to urge Washington to proceed with a cut to tariffs on cars as promised in last month’s trade deal.
Ryosei Akazawa’s trip to Washington will be his first following the announcement of the trade agreement. The deal, reached after his eighth visit to the US capital since April, resulted in a pledge by the US to assess a 15% tariff on most imports of Japanese goods.
