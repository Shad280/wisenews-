The Czech central bank is poised to hold interest rates for a second meeting after some policymakers signaled an end to monetary easing.
The Czech National Bank will keep the benchmark at 3.5% on Thursday, according to all analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That decision would break the stop-and-go pattern of easing which saw rate cuts in February and May.
