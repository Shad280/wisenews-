Senior security officials from Cambodia and Thailand began talks in Malaysia on Monday aimed at de-escalating border tensions, after the worst clash between the two Southeast Asian nation neighbors in decades left more than 40 dead.
The meeting of the so-called General Border Committee — one of several bilateral mechanisms between the two nations to address border matters — was shifted to Kuala Lumpur following Thailand’s request to move it to a neutral venue due to what it described as a sensitive situation.
