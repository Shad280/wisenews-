Beijing’s special envoy Xue Bing told a regional conference that ‘all parties should engage in dialogue’ to achieve common prosperity
China has reaffirmed its support for peaceful development in the Horn of Africa, saying it would “actively engage” in regional initiatives to promote the concept.
Beijing’s special envoy Xue Bing made the pledge at a conference on the topic in the Ugandan capital Kampala on Tuesday, a Chinese-led event that involved representatives from eight countries in East Africa.
Xue said Beijing would offer military assistance and training, as well as helping to develop the region’s infrastructure and boosting trade.
“The world today faces overlapping risks and challenges that threaten peace and development in the Horn of Africa, and all parties should engage in dialogue and cooperation to maintain universal security and achieve common prosperity,” Xue told the event, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.
Xue outlined further areas of cooperation, including counterterrorism and landmine eradication, while stressing China’s support for “African-led solutions” through platforms such as the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.
