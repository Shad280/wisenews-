Digital asset manager Parataxis Holdings is officially going public through a SPAC deal with SilverBox Corp IV, confirming earlier plans to list, it announced in a press release on Wednesday.
The new entity will be called Parataxis Holdings Inc. and aims to trade under the ticker “PRTX” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
At a $10 share price, the deal values the combined company at $400 million, with the potential to double that figure if Parataxis exercises the right to raise an additional $400 million through a share purchase agreement. About $31 million has already been raised and earmarked for purchasing bitcoin BTC$114,838.71, giving future shareholders immediate exposure to the asset.
Parataxis manages bitcoin in an active strategy that blends market exposure with yield-generating techniques. Unlike firms that simply hold BTC, Parataxis seeks to generate income through low-volatility trading and treasury-style operations. The platform is run by veterans from Parataxis Capital Management and serves institutional client, including pension firms and family offices.
In June, Parataxis made its first international move by acquiring a controlling stake in Bridge Biotherapeutics, a healthcare firm listed on South Korea’s KOSDAQ. That firm will be renamed Parataxis Korea and serve as a regional base for its bitcoin treasury strategy. Since the announcement, Bridge shares have jumped 350%, showing strong investor demand for the bitcoin-proxy play.
South Korea offers a large user base, political support for digital assets, and notably, no spot Bitcoin ETF — making the market fertile ground for BTC-focused public firms, the company said. Similar strategies have gained traction in Japan, where companies like Metaplanet have seen share prices surge after pivoting to bitcoin.
The Parataxis-SPAC deal will also allow the firm to expand its U.S. treasury operations and explore other “special situations” investments. If successful, Parataxis could become one of the few publicly listed companies offering direct and active exposure to bitcoin outside of an ETF structure.
The transaction is expected to close pending shareholder approval and a review from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
