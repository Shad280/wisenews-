Indian officials have struggled to engage in diplomatic talks with President Donald Trump’s administration because key foreign policy roles in Washington remain unfilled, people familiar with the matter said, making it difficult for New Delhi to effectively push for a trade deal and ward off the US leader’s recent attacks against the nation.
Several positions in the Department of State and the Department of Defense are vacant, which has made it harder for India to lobby its view, the people said, asking not to be identified to discuss a sensitive matter.
