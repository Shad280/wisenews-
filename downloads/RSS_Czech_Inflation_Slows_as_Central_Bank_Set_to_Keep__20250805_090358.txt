Czech inflation slowed in July but remained above the central bankâ€™s target as policymakers are expected to keep interest rate unchanged this week to tackle persistent price pressures.
Consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, in line with the median analyst estimate and compared with 2.9% growth in the previous month, according to preliminary data published by the Czech Statistics Office on Tuesday.
