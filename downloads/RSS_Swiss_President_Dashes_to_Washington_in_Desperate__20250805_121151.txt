Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter is flying to Washington on Tuesday in a last-minute bid for a deal to lower the 39% tariff imposed last week by Donald Trump.
The trip is to “facilitate meetings with the US authorities at short notice and hold talks,” the government said in a statementBloomberg Terminal. Keller-Sutter’s office declined to say whether she expects to meet the American president and what trade concessions she might bring before Thursday’s deadline to implement the levy.
