The PAS official defended his bizarre cattle analogy as ‘art of the Malay language’, even as his own coalition joined the criticism of it
In a convoluted social media post on Sunday, Muhammad Salman Al Farisi, a local official from the Islamist PAS party, likened women leaders to cows – invoking his own herd of cattle to illustrate.
“When a female cow is appointed as the leader, she decides everything, while the males around her only know how to graze the crops,” wrote the youth information chief for PAS’ Maran branch.
“That’s why, if possible, we shouldn’t be like cows that elevate their ‘female’ as their leader.”
His remarks were immediately condemned as “demeaning” and “outdated”, not only by the public on social media but also from within his own opposition coalition.
