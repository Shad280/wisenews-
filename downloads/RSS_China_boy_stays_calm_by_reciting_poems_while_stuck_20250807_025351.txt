After pressing emergency button to get help, boy tries to uplift spirits by repeating phrases such as ‘Help is on the way’, ‘Stay strong’
An eight-year-old boy in China who found himself alone in a stuck lift reacted to his predicament with remarkable calmness, garnering widespread praise online.
The surveillance camera in the lift of a residential building in northern China’s Hebei province captured the entire incident.
The unnamed boy, trapped on the 11th floor while en route to his flat, initially pressed the buttons for other floors and then gently tapped on the lift door to assess his situation.
Upon realising he was stuck, he pressed the emergency button.
Loudly yet politely, he informed the helpline operator of his situation and location.
The operator, from the property management company, reassured him that help was on the way.
