While bitcoin BTC$114,817.25 and ether (ETH) prices have recouped a significant portion of last week's losses, hinting at a "buy the dip" resurgence, the latest ETF flows paint a different picture.
On Monday, the nine spot ether ETFs recorded total net outflows of $465 million — the largest on record — following Friday's $152 million drawdown, according to SoSoValue. Bitcoin ETFs also saw substantial outflows, bleeding $333 million after Friday's $812 million, suggesting that institutional capital is not as sanguine as the spot market.
Meantime, long-term bullishness has evaporated from BTC options as concerns of renewed U.S. inflation and a labor-market slowdown weigh on investors' risk appetite.
On the flip side, some analysts still hold a largely constructive market outlook while anticipating Fed interest-rate cuts.
"Despite the short-term volatility, structural data still suggests the U.S. is undergoing a growth slowdown, not a full recession," Chloe Zheng, a research analyst at HTX, told CoinDesk. "Household debt remains low relative to income, credit stress is contained, and business lending growth continues. This mix of softening labor data and easing inflation expectations historically precedes monetary easing — placing risk assets like BTC in a high-volatility, liquidity-sensitive window."
Data from the CME's FedWatch tool shows that traders have priced in three rate cuts by the January 2026 meeting, meaning the Fed is expected to lower borrowing costs in three out of the next four meetings.
According to Paul Howard, a senior director at crypto market-making firm Wincent, new crypto market highs hinge on Fed rate cuts.
"The next big piece of macro news will likely come with U.S. rate changes, possibly as early as September," Howare said. "If that does happen, then we can expect prices to catapult through current ATH as cheap money looks for yield. My sense is BTC and the major alts would then see strong outperformance in Q4."
Speaking of the broader market, on-chain stablecoin volume hit a record high of over $1.5 trillion in July, according to analytics firm Sentora. Uniswap v4, which debuted at the end of January, has surpassed $100 million in trading volume, according to data tracked by 21Shares.
In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures traded flat to positive, indicating a dull open following Monday's 1.3% gain. The dollar index traded slightly higher near 99.00, while gold dropped to $3,360 per ounce, as the freight market cratered, sending a warning to the economy. Stay alert!
