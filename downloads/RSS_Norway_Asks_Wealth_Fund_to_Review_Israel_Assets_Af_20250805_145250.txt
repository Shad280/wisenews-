Israel-Hamas War:
Norway’s government ordered the country’s sovereign wealth fund to review all its investments in Israel after a report about its holding in an Israeli company linked to the war in Gaza triggered a public outcry.
Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who oversees the $1.9 trillion wealth fund, told reporters in Oslo on Tuesday he “understands people are asking questions” about how closely the fund is following its ethical guidelines that exclude companies that contribute to serious violations of human rights, including war crimes.
