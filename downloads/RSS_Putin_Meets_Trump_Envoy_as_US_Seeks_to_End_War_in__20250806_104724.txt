War in Ukraine:
The White House is racing to beat another self-imposed deadline to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine, with President Donald Trump leaning hard on his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to get Moscow to halt the fighting.
President Vladimir Putin began talks with Witkoff in the Kremlin on Wednesday, just two days before an Aug. 8 deadline Trump set for Russia to reach a truce or face potential sanctions. While Putin has said he won’t abandon his campaign in Ukraine, people familiar with the situation said the Kremlin might offer the US concessions that could include halting airstrikes in a bid to avert new economic penalties.
