Aim is to create new generation of ‘grill masters’ to staff country’s multimillion dollar skewered meat industry
A Chinese university has sparked disbelief by partnering to establish the country’s first Barbecue Research Institute.
The unusual institute aims to professionalise the beloved street food industry and train a new generation of grill masters.
Yueyang Open University in central China’s Hunan province has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Yueyang Barbecue Association to jointly establish the Yueyang Barbecue Research Institute.
The ambitious plan aims to train 1,000 professional barbecue artisans within three years.
The programme spans two and a half years of theoretical study followed by a six-month internship. Each year, it plans to enrol between 50 and 100 students.
Specialised courses on craftsmanship and business management will be offered.
The programme will be open to middle school graduates, out-of-school youth, and current industry practitioners looking to upgrade their skills and obtain professional qualifications.
