NYC Mayoral Race:
New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo
Andrew Cuomo said that either he or Eric Adams will need to drop out of the race for New York mayor against Queens Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani by the middle of next month, otherwise the democratic socialist will defeat a divided field.
“Everyone is petrified about electing a socialist who is anti-police,” Cuomo, the former governor, said Tuesday on Bloomberg Radio. Mid-September, he said, is “the drop-dead date when you have to winnow down the field, or people will think there’s no way to beat the assemblyman.”
