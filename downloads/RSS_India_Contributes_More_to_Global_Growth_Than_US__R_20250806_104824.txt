Reserve Bank of India governor Sanjay Malhotra
India’s central bank governor said the country contributes more to global growth than the US, responding to President Donald Trump’s recent remark dismissing the South Asian nation as a “dead” economy.
“We have a very robust growth rate,” Governor Sanjay Malhotra told reporters after a policy meet on Wednesday. “We are contributing about 18% which is more than US, where the contribution is expected to be much less at about 11% or something. We are doing very well and we will continue to further improve.”
