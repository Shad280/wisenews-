Thailand-Cambodia Clash:
Thai and Cambodian delegatesÂ ahead of the Extraordinary General Border Committee to discuss the border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia, in Kuala Lumpur ,on Aug. 7.
Cambodia and Thailand agreed to uphold a ceasefire, more than one week after a US-backed truce ended the deadliest clashes between the Southeast Asian neighbors in recent history.
A meeting of senior security officials from the two nations held in Kuala Lumpur approved a set of measures to strictly enforce the truce and ease border tensions. The so-called General Border Committee meeting also agreed not to move or reinforce troops and weapons along the disputed border. It also endorsed monitoring of the ceasefire by an interim team of Asean defense attaches led by Malaysia, Thai officials said at a briefing.
