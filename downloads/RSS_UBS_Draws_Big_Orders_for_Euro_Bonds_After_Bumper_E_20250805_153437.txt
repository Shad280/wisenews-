UBS Group AG drew strong demand for a euro debt sale, days after raising dollar debt following better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
The Swiss lender pulled in combined orders for more than six times its â‚¬2 billion ($2.3 billion) sale of HoldCo debt due in six and 11 years, according to a person with knowledge of the sale, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. Both notes can be called a year earlier than maturity.
