Marcos’ ‘landmark’ visit reflects the countries’ growing convergence on defence and economic interests, analysts say
Beyond the ceremony, analysts say the trip reflects a growing convergence between Manila and New Delhi on maritime security, defence cooperation and economic resilience – a relationship shaped by shared democratic values, overlapping interests in the Indo-Pacific, and parallel tensions with China.
“As this year marks 75 years of India-Philippines diplomatic relations, President Marcos Jnr’s visit will be seen as a landmark in the bilateral relationship,” Pooja Bhatt, associate professor at the Jindal School of International Affairs, told This Week in Asia.
On Tuesday, Marcos and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos were formally welcomed at the presidential residence in Delhi, Rashtrapati Bhavan, following a meeting the previous day between Marcos and the Filipino community in India.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the two leaders held wide-ranging talks on Tuesday, discussing “mutual cooperation, regional issues, and international situations in detail”.
