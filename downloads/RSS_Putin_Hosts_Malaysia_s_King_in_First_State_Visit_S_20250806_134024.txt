Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Malaysia’s King Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar at the Kremlin on Wednesday, as the two nations look to shore up ties amid shifting global alliances.
It’s the first state visit of a monarch from Malaysia to Russia since diplomatic relations were established with the Soviet Union in 1967.
