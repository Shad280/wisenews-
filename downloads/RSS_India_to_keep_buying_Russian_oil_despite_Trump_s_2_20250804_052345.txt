Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has struck a defiant tone in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, urging the nation to buy local goods as his administration signaled it would continue buying Russian oil.
Modi’s government hasn’t given India’s oil refiners instructions to stop buying Russian oil, and no decision has been taken on whether to halt the purchases, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Both state-run and private refiners are allowed to buy from preferred sources, and crude purchases remain a commercial decision, several of the people said.
