The UK’s retail investors have sold more than £50 billion ($66.46 billion) worth of domestic equity funds since 2020, which could be adding to the market’s underperformance, according to Panmure Liberum analysts.
Mom-and-pop investors have been ditching UK equity funds for international exposure in recent years, according to a report on Tuesday from analysts Joachim Klement and Susana Cruz. Alongside the outflows from local funds, they piled more than £25 billion into foreign equity baskets, said the note, citing data from The Investment Association through May.
