Security minister Chris Tang invokes Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to also cancel passports of 12 overseas activists
Hong Kong authorities have introduced new punitive measures targeting 16 overseas activists wanted for alleged national security offences, prohibiting anyone from funding them and cancelling most of the abscondersâ€™ passports.
The 16 targeted activists include Victor Ho Leung-mau, Chin Po-fun and Chan Lai-chun.
The government has prohibited anyone from making available or dealing with funds and certain activities in connection with the immovable property of all 16 wanted activists, while also banning any joint ventures or partnerships with them.
It also cancelled the Hong Kong passports of 12 of the 16 absconders.
