Sunshine Lake Pharma’s shares fell in their trading debut in Hong Kong, as the city’s buzz over first-day trading took a breather while the stock market sought fresh directions from mainland China’s macroeconomic statistics and trade talks.
“The company will accelerate the integration of high-quality resources, speed up the commercialisation and globalisation of its innovative drug pipeline, and inject strong momentum into sustainable growth”, Sunshine’s chairman Zhang Yingjun said at the HKEX’s Connect Hall, before striking a ceremonial gong to mark the commencement of trading.
“Our responsibility is heavy and the road is long, but we will dedicate ourselves to our chosen path. This listing is a new starting point for us. We will follow the path of hi-tech R&D and innovation to produce excellent medicines for patients and improve our performance to build a world-class pharmaceutical company.”
