Oil extended a three-day drop, as investors weighed risks to Russian supplies, with US President Donald Trump stepping up a threat to penalize India for buying Moscow’s crude.
Brent traded near $68 a barrel after shedding more than 6% over the previous three sessions, while West Texas Intermediate was just shy of $66.
