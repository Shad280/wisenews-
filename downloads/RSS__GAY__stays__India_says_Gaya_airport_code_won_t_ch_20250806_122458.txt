Despite numerous complaints about the IATA code for the sacred city’s airport, Indian officials say it can’t be altered
The clarification came after Bhim Singh, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, told the Rajya Sabha – the upper house of India’s parliament – on Tuesday that the term “gay” was “socially and culturally offensive and uncomfortable”, especially for a religious destination like Gaya.
Gaya, in eastern Bihar, is one of India’s oldest and most sacred cities – a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus and Buddhists. Nearby Bodh Gaya, just about 5 km away, is the site where Gautama Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment, and its Mahabodhi Temple was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in June 2002.
Singh asked if the government had received complaints about the code and whether it intended to consider a change to a “more respectful and culturally appropriate” alternative, according to the Hindustan Times.
In a written reply, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol said the code was assigned by the IATA, and that changes were only permitted under limited criteria.
“IATA location codes are considered permanent and are altered only under exceptional circumstances, usually involving air safety concerns,” Mohol told the Rajya Sabha, as quoted by The Hans India.
