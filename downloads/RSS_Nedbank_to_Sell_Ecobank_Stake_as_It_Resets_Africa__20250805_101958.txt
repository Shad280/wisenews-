Nedbank Group Ltd. plans to sell its stake in pan-African lender Ecobank Transnational Inc. to focus on businesses in the southern and East African regions.
The South African lenderâ€™s disposal of its 21.2% stake in Togo-based Ecobank will mark the end of a 17-year strategic alliance that enabled Nedbank to expand its footprint beyond its home region.
