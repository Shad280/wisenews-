Protesters during an anti-corruption demonstration, in Kyiv, on July 31.
Ukraineâ€™s Cabinet of Ministers appointed a new head of the Economic Security Bureau after weeks of delay, responding to public pressure over the issue amid a political crisis over the independence of anti-corruption agencies.
Oleksandr Tsyvinskyi, a former anti-graft investigator, was recommended by an independent committee in June but the cabinet controversially refused to appoint him, alleging security risks due to family ties to Russia.
