Canada is seeking closer collaboration with Mexico in multiple sectors amid a trade war with the US, senior ministers said during a visit that included a long meeting with President Claudia Sheinbaum.
The two nations agreed “to build a work plan” covering “resilient supply chains, port-to-port lines of trade, artificial intelligence and the digital economy, energy security,” Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said in a call with reporters late Tuesday. Accompanied by Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, their conversation with Sheinbaum lasted “well over an hour,” she said.
