A "one-in, one-out" deal in which Britain can return some migrants who cross the Channel in small boats back to France came into force on Tuesday, the U.K. government announced.
The interior ministry said that British authorities were "operationally ready" and that migrant detentions were expected to begin "within days" following ratification of the agreement.
