Thailand-Cambodia Clash:
Thailandâ€™s cabinet approved the purchase of four Gripen fighter jets as part of a broader plan to modernize its military, days after its air force used the Swedish-made jets in a deadly border clash with neighboring Cambodia.
The cabinet cleared the acquisition of Gripen E/F jets worth 19.5 billion baht ($600 million) from Saab AB, said Prapas Sornchaidee, a spokesman for the Royal Thai Air Force. In June, Thai Air Force had announced plans to buy a total of 12 jets over a 10-year period.
