Figure Technology Solutions said on Monday it has filed confidential paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public later this year.
Figure is joining a growing list of digital asset firms aiming to go public, seeking capitalizing on the booming cryptocurrency and stock markets and recent U.S. regulatory advancements after Donald Trump took office with a pro-crypto agenda. Earlier this year, USDC (USDC) stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) had a blockbuster debut on the Nasdaq, with shares zooming to $300 from the IPO priced at around $30. Custodian BitGo, asset manager Grayscale and exchange operator and CoinDesk owner Bullish filed for IPOs as well.
Figure, founded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, has played a key role in the red-hot real-world asset (RWA) sector, originating over $16 billion in home equity lines of credit using the Provenance Blockchain. The firm last month announced a merger with Figure Markets, the blockchain-based marketplace also founded by Cagney and issuer of a yield-bearing stablecoin that operates as a tokenized money market fund (YDLS).
