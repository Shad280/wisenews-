Dr Wong Hoi-kei says World Health Organization and experts are still conducting research on safety and efficacy of chikungunya fever vaccine
Anti-mosquito measures remain the most effective way to combat chikungunya fever in Hong Kong, health authorities have said, as the vaccine is neither widely used worldwide nor approved locally.
Dr Wong Hoi-kei, a senior medical and health officer from the Centre for Health Protection, also said on Monday that chikungunya fever was unlikely to become endemic in the city despite a medium to high risk of local transmission.
“The vaccine for chikungunya fever is still relatively new and has not been widely used in any countries,” he told a radio show.
“The World Health Organization and experts are still researching its safety and efficacy … the vaccine is only used on a small scale and very high-risk individuals for now.”
The most effective prevention was to avoid bites from mosquitoes and curb their breeding, Wong added.
He also said that although the risk of imported cases of chikungunya fever was high, it remained “within expectations” due to the frequency of travel between Hong Kong and Guangdong.
