Home sales in Toronto rose the most in nine months as the Canadian economy appeared to hold up in the face of uncertainty sparked by US President Donald Trump’s trade war.
The number of homes that changed hands in Canada’s largest city rose 13% in July from June, the biggest monthly gain since October, according to seasonally adjusted data released Wednesday by the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. The benchmark price of a home slipped 0.2% over the same period, hitting C$979,000 ($710,000), one of the smallest declines seen in the past year, the data show.
