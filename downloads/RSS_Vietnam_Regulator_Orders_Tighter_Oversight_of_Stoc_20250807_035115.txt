The Hanoi Stock Exchange in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Vietnam’s State Securities Commission has directed stock exchanges and relevant agencies to strengthen supervision of equity transactions following a recent sharp rally in the market.
The SSC said bourses need to “closely monitor” transactions that involve sharp price moves, or those that show signs of “unusual” activities, according to a statement posted on its website. It also ordered the exchanges to coordinate with Vietnam Securities Depository and Clearing Corp. to ensure safe, stable and smooth securities trading, clearing and settlement.
