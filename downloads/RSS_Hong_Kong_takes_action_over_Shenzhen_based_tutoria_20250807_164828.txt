Tutorial centre Capture Star has promoted programme on social media, claiming to be partnering with Tsung Tsin Middle School
Hong Kong education authorities are taking law enforcement action against a Shenzhen-based tutorial centre that planned to recruit students for its university entrance exam programmes at a local private secondary school without registering.
The Education Bureau said on Thursday that it had not received an application from the tutorial centre Capture Star to operate a school or run educational courses at premises currently occupied by the private Tsung Tsin Middle School in Cheung Sha Wan.
“The Education Bureau is taking appropriate law enforcement actions against Capture Star for recruiting students into its programmes before it was approved as a registered school,” it said in a reply to the Post.
“The bureau has also contacted the person in charge of Tsung Tsin Middle School for an explanation.”
The move came after Capture Star promoted a Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam programme for the 2025 school year on social media, claiming to be partnering with Tsung Tsin.
“Tsung Tsin Middle School in Hong Kong will be providing registered student status, school campus and hardware facilities, while Capture Star will be responsible for the teaching of the DSE programme, curriculum development and further education counselling,” said the promotion, which was still displayed on the centre’s social media account.
