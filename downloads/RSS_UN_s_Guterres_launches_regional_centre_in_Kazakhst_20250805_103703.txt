UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres established a regional development centre for Central Asia and Afghanistan on Sunday, signing an agreement with Kazakhstan to coordinate sustainable development efforts across the landlocked region.
“The centre represents the opening of a new chapter – for the region and for our collective journey towards the sustainable development goals,” Guterres said in his speech during his visit to Almaty.
“And it holds great potential for showing how the strong bonds among the region’s leaders can translate into deeper economic integration, for the benefit of all people.”
Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev noted that the establishment of the centre sends a strong message to the international community, highlighting Central Asia’s growing significance as a key player on the global stage.
“The centre will act as a catalyst for coordinated action to strengthen the resilience and dynamism of our economies, develop regional innovation and deepen cooperation,” he said, adding that it should complement the ongoing work the UN conducts in the region.
The centre, which was mandated by the UN General Assembly in March, will bring together local and international stakeholders to address key issues like climate change, gender inequality and youth unemployment.
Guterres’ visit to Kazakhstan comes on the eve of the Third United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries in Turkmenistan, which both he and President Tokayev are to attend.
A notable aspect of the agreement is the inclusion of Afghanistan in the scope of the centre’s work.
“The people of Afghanistan continue to face immense hardship – from entrenched poverty and mass displacement to earthquakes, climate shocks, and a fragile humanitarian landscape,” Guterres said.
He noted that the centre will collaborate with regional and international partners to assist Afghanistan in achieving sustainable development, prioritising human rights while fostering economic independence, peace, and dignity.
Tokayev, in turn, noted that peace and long-term development in Afghanistan are a guarantee of regional security.
“Kazakhstan remains committed to supporting the Afghan people through humanitarian aid, educational projects, trade development and food security initiatives," the Kazakhstan president said.
"Trade between our countries is growing steadily. We are convinced that peace and development in Afghanistan must go hand in hand,” he emphasised.
Last month, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that expressed concern over the country's deteriorating humanitarian, economic and human rights crises, calling for international support for the people of Afghanistan.
In a statement, it noted that “2025 humanitarian needs and response plan for Afghanistan – which seeks $2.4 billion to assist nearly 17 million people – is only 22% funded.” It is possible that the new regional centre will focus on facilitating this work through intraregional cooperation.
