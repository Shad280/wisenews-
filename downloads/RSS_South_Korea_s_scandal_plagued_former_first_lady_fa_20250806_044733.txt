With her husband already in custody, Kim is now being questioned over her role in gift and stock scandals – and a surprise trip to Ukraine
As Kim, 52, arrived at the Seoul office of Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, she was confronted by a barrage of shouted questions and camera lenses, in what has become a ritualistic moment of accountability for those in South Korean public life.
Turning to the assembled crowd, her voice subdued by the media clamour, Kim said: “Even though I am so insignificant, I sincerely apologise for causing public concern.”
“I’ll fully cooperate with the investigation and return,” she added before disappearing inside the building and away from view.
The sight of a former first lady being summoned so publicly is unprecedented in South Korea, a nation accustomed to seeing politicians and business leaders humble themselves before the press in moments of public reckoning. While two previous first ladies have faced private questioning, Kim is the first to be called before the cameras.
