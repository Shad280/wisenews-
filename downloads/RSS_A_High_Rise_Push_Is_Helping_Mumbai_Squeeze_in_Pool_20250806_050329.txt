Mumbai residences are getting smaller as growing wealth in India’s financial capital increases demand for luxury amenities.
In the space-crunched city, apartment developers are building projects that dedicate less space to individual units while offering more communal amenities such as pools, lawns and gyms. That’s because buyers and renters are willing to pay more for such comforts in a city plagued by noise and air pollution, traffic congestion and crowded streets while remaining close to family or employers.
