Trump’s Second Term:
Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump will meet for summit talks within the next few days, the Kremlin said Thursday.
Russia and the US have agreed on a venue for the meeting and “together with our American colleagues, we are starting to work on specific issues,” with a goal for the talks to take place next week, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters, according to the Interfax news service. He didn’t identify where the summit will be held.
