App offers platform for residents to access services such as force’s e-Report Centre, emergency rescue and Scameter search engine
Hong Kong police will launch a “super app” equipped with an AI chatbot on Sunday to provide a one-stop platform offering about 50 e-services to the public.
Senior Superintendent Swalikh Mohammed of the force’s digital policing services bureau said on Monday that the mobile app offered six new functions, including an AI chatbot named “Yes Sir”.
“This super app offers a one-stop service platform where residents can find around 50 different police services without having to go to various places,” he said.
Users can log in to the new app through the Hong Kong Police Force’s digital services platform or through iAM Smart – the government’s digital identity platform that allows residents to access various services, auto-fill forms and perform legal digital signings.
After logging in, icons representing different types of services will be displayed, including e-Report Centre, HKSOS for emergency rescue, and Scameter, a search engine to check suspicious or fraudulent links and phone numbers.
“The app’s interface is more user-friendly so that the public can get the most commonly used police services that they need on a daily basis,” said Johnson Chan Joon-sun, the force’s deputy commissioner.
The first generation of the police mobile app was launched in 2012, and the new version was developed to integrate and further digitise the force’s services.
