The tables, ladders and chairs match between six tag teams delivered in a big way at SummerSlam. There were a ton of bodies going through tables, even Candice LeRae saw action and was sent through a ladder.
As the carnage subsided, Joe Gacy was able to race up the ladder and grab the tag team belts to bring the gold back to the Wyatt Sicks family.
Gacy and Dexter Lumis have made it clear that they are the cream of the crop in the tag-team division on the SmackDown roster.

Becky Lynch tried her best to really hurt Lyra Valkyria and make sure she never challenges for the Women’s Intercontinental Championship again in their no disqualification match.
But it was Bayley, who interfered in the match, who ended up delivering the final blow that sent Valkyria into the Manhandle Slam from Lynch.
Lynch pinned Valkyria to pick up the victory.
Jacob Fatu was outmatched even with Solo Sikoa’s My Family Tree members having to fight a cage to get involved in the match.
With distractions about, Fatu took his eyes off of Sikoa and paid the price for it. Sikoa was able to slip out of the cage and win the match via escape.
Fatu got some revenge on his vials but he left without the title.
Dominik Mysterio continued the trend of champions retaining their titles with a victory over A.J. Styles late in the night at SummerSlam.
Sure, he needed to hit Styles with his actual boot to do it, but Mysterio has proven to be a successful intercontinental champion so far. He’s defended it in every match since winning it at WrestleMania.
More gold could be on the way for the son of Rey Mysterio.

As Cena said farewell to the fans, Brock Lesnar’s music hit.
