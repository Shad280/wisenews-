In their Comment, Kemerink and colleagues1 raised concerns about the proof of ferroelectricity in the peptide-programmed supramolecular assemblies reported in our paper2. The main issue pointed out by Kemerink and colleagues is that the polarization versus electric field curves (P–E loops) measured by the in-plane set-up in our paper show unsaturated remnant polarization strengths with increasing amplitude of driving voltage, which is not expected in typical ferroelectrics. For this Reply, we have completed further experiments that we believe explain the apparent non-saturating behaviour of remnant polarization attributed by Kemerink and colleagues to inconclusive proof of ferroelectricity in our samples1.
