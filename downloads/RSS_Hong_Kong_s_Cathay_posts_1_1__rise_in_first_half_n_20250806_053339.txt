Robust, sustainable growth was maintained by strong passenger traffic and lower fuel prices, chairman Patrick Healy says
Group chairman Patrick Healy said on Wednesday that the robust, sustainable growth was thanks to strong passenger traffic and lower fuel prices. He also revealed that the company would make interim dividend payments at 56.70 HK cents a share.
“Our first-half result was driven by higher passenger volumes, albeit with lower yields, a consistent cargo performance, and lower fuel price compared with the same period in 2024,” he said, announcing the first interim dividend remained the same at 20 HK cents a share.
The Cathay Group also posted a 9.5 per cent increase in revenue, reaching HK$54.3 billion compared with HK$49.6 billion in the same period last year.
Cathay’s budget arm, HK Express, had its loss before net finance charges and taxation widened to HK$524 million for the first half from HK$73 million in the same corresponding period last year.
The group said it felt the impact of the earthquake rumours, which drove passengers away from Japan, its core market. It added that new routes took time to generate contributions.
