Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries won a multi-billion dollar deal to build a fleet of advanced naval frigates for Australia, boosting Tokyo’s ambitions to become a major exporter of military equipment and develop its defense sector.
MHI was chosen over Germany’s Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems to build eleven frigates optimized for undersea warfare and air defense that will replace Australia’s Anzac-class warships. The replacement program has a budget of between 7 billion and 11 billion Australian dollars ($4.3 billion to $6.8 billion).
