Trump’s Tariffs:
Infineon Technologies AG shares rose after the German chipmaker said a hit from tariffs in the fourth fiscal quarter would be less than it anticipated and it forecast better-than-expected margins this year as the industry recovers from several quarters of depressed demand.
Chief Executive Officer Jochen Hanebeck said the company’s forecast in May — that tariffs would contribute to a 10% revenue reduction in the period — was too pessimistic. The impact for the quarter ending in September “will be less pronounced than expected,” Hanebeck said on a call with reporters after the company’s financial results on Tuesday.
