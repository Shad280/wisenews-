Apollo Global Management Inc. reported record earnings from fees in the second quarter, driven by a boost in lending activity and a bump in managed assets, but reeled in less money from wealthy individuals.
The firm collected $61 billion in the quarter, bringing its total managed assets to $840 billion, according to a statement Tuesday. Analysts had expected Apollo to report about $812 billion of assets, Bloomberg-compiled estimates show.
