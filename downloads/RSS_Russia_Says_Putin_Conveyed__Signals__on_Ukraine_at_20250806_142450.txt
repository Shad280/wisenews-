War in Ukraine:
Vladimir Putin exchanged “signals” with Donald Trump on the war in Ukraine at Kremlin talks with US envoy Steve Witkoff, a top Russian official said Wednesday.
“On our part, in particular, some signals were conveyed on the Ukrainian issue,” the Russian president’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters, without elaborating. “Corresponding signals were also received from President Trump.”
