Trump’s Tariffs:
Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter will meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio on her emergency trip to lower the US’s 39% tariff, while it remains unclear if she will also get to see Donald Trump.
Rubio’s schedule for Wednesday shows a 10:15 a.m. meeting in DC with Keller-Sutter, though it didn’t provide any further details. The US Secretary of State’s department doesn’t lead negotiations for bilateral deals.
