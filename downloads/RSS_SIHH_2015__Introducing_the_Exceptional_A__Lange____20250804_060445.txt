It's January and every watch geek knows what that means. Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, more commonly referred to as SIHH, has arrived! Amongst the exhibitors at this grandiose affair are Cartier, Piaget, Vacheron Constantin, A. Lange & Sohne, and a plethora of other Richemont brands and independent watchmaking houses. When it comes to ultra-luxury watches, I tend to prefer the simpler designs, such as the new Saxonia Automatik by A. Lange & Sohne.
Just the thought of a 38.5 millimeter dress watch, for quite some time, I considered gauche. But since seeing Lange's reinvented Saxonia Automatik, not only has my outlook on relatively large timepieces changed, but I'd be down to wear this watch any day.
Its brilliant pink gold case is home to the splendid manufacture calibre L086.1 self-winding movement. As Lange's 50th in-house caliber, this movement marks a milestone in the company's great history as Germany's foremost watch manufacture. I must add, never have I witnessed a finer finishing on any other automatic movement, and Lange's creative use of German Silver is definitely something to laud. As expected, a power reserve of 72 hours and many components--209, to be exact.
What I admire most about this piece is the elegant, simplistic solid silver dial. Oversized would be an understatement, but surely the dial is nothing flashy.  If there was a perfectly-balanced dress watch, one that you can wear (almost) anywhere, the A. Lange & Sohne Saxonia Automatik would be it.
