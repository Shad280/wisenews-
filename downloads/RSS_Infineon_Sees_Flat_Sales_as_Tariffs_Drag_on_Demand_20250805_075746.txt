Trump’s Tariffs:
German auto chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG said it expects flat sales in the current quarter, as uncertainties about tariffs weigh on customers’ spending plans and dampen an industry recovery.
Revenue in the period ending in September will be flat from a year earlier at about €3.9 billion ($4.5 billion), Infineon said in a statement on Tuesday. That compares to an average analyst estimate of €4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
