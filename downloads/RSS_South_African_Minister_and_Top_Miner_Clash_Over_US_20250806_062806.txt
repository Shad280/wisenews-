A proposal by South Africa’s biggest mining company and other business leaders advising President Cyril Ramaphosa on how to offer the US access to Africa’s critical minerals angered the nation’s mining minister who saw it as an attempt by the firm to advance its own interests.
The plan was put forward by the group, which included Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman and board member Rick Menell, before Ramaphosa’s May 21 meeting with President Donald Trump. Mines Minister Gwede Mantashe said he objected because his department hadn’t been involved in its creation, and neither had the Minerals Council South Africa, which represents most mining companies operating in the country.
