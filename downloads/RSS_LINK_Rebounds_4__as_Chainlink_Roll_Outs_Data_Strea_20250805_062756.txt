The price of LINK (LINK), native token of oracle provider Chainlink, climbed 4% on Monday extending its rebound from late last week's crypto carnage.
The token hit $17 during the session, up nearly 10% from the weekend lows, CoinDesk data shows.
The move occurred as Chainlink rolled out market data feed for U.S. Equities and ETFs, aiming to connect traditional financial instrument with on-chain capital markets. Chainlink Data Streams now provide "real-time, high-throughput pricing" for assets such as SPY, QQQ, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, and other instruments across 37 blockchain networks, according to a blog post. The feature enables use cases such as tokenized stock trading, perpetual futures and synthetic ETFs on blockchain rails.
Solana-based DeFi protocol Kamino and decentraliized perpetuals trading venue GMX have already started using the service, according to the post.
"This is a significant leap forward for tokenized markets â€” closing a critical gap between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure," Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, said in the post.
LINK exhibited remarkable bullish performance throughout the 24-hour trading session, climbing from $16.16 to $16.87 and delivering a substantial 4.39% gain, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.
The persistent upward momentum, distinguished by progressively higher lows and consistently above-average volume during rally phases, indicates sustained bullish market sentiment with strong potential for additional gains targeting the $17.00 psychological threshold, the model said.
