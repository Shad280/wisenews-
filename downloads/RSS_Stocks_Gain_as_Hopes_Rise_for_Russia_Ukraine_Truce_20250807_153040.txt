US Stocks:
Stocks rose as President Donald Trump declared plans for a 100% tariff on chip imports, but vowed to exempt companies that invest in US. Trader sentiment was also buoyed by prospects of de-escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine.
While the S&P 500 pared gains, it remained near its all-time highs. The Nasdaq 100 rose about 1%. Apple Inc. extended a two-day surge to 8%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers jumped 2%, but Intel Corp. slipped as Trump called on its chief to resign, citing conflicts of interest.
