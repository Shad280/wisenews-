US Stocks:
Caterpillar Inc. reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit as the cost of tariffs and slightly lower prices eroded margins for the company’s iconic yellow diggers and bulldozers.
The results show the evolving impact of US trade policy on the industries that Caterpillar serves, as tariff-driven headwinds push up manufacturing costs, hurting profit even as sales volume remained steady. The net impact from tariffs in the second quarter was at the top end of the company’s estimated range of $250 million to $350 million disclosed in April.
