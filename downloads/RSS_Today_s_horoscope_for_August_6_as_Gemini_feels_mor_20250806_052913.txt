It’s Wednesday, and one star sign can expect an improvement in close relationships, while another will be pleased with the consequences of their actions.
There are 12 zodiac signs - Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces - and the horoscopes for each can give you the lowdown on what your future holds, be it in work, your love life, your friends and family or more.
These daily forecasts have been compiled by astrologer Russell Grant, who has been reading star signs for over 50 years. From Aries through to Pisces, here's what today could bring for your horoscope - and what you can do to be prepared.
Before taking on anything new think of the importance of maintaining your health and inner peace. An unforeseen issue around midday will call for you to drop what you are doing to give someone a helping hand. A partner will question your sincerity. Work to reassure them, this evening.
Changes that are happening now might benefit your career but the impact they are having on your personal life may not be as positive. You prefer to rely on logic and common sense which makes it hard to understand an emotional relative. In a day of surprises, rather than complaining, wait patiently for it to pass.
An improvement in close relationships will make you feel as if you can overcome any obstacle that’s in your way. As harmony is restored, you feel more hopeful about your future but this alone, will not transform your life overnight. Keep your decisions practical.
All you can do when events aren’t going fast enough for you is: wait patiently. The outcomes of your current endeavours may seem minimal but that’s because this is not the end. Eventually you will be pleased with the consequences of your actions. Bide your time.
A situation will need you to take immediate action. You have been pushing yourself hard and now is the time to prioritise your well-being. If you value your health, slow down, reassess your diet and put an end to bad habits.
Setbacks in career or financial matters will cause frustration. Just keep reminding yourself that this is not your fault. Challenges you face are largely due to circumstances beyond your control. A housemate’s or colleague’s past behaviour now presents problems one after another.
A meeting or conversation will feel excessively drawn out, largely due to a few conflicts and issues. Arguments over trivial matters will exhaust you. Later, at work, you could be provoked by the rude comments of a colleague. By evening, don’t be surprised if you feel utterly drained.
You’re being prompted to reconsider your perspectives on circumstances surrounding you. For the sake of your emotional health you cannot remain fixated on negativity and hostility. Someone genuinely wants to help you. This could bring about a positive transformation.
It will be a senior member of the family who draws you into some unexpected conflict. They have strong views and these will not be what you had expected to hear. You want to show respect but you also need to express your feelings especially if you feel you are being unjustly criticised.
Everyone has a right to voice their opinions. Whether it is a close friend, neighbour or relative, even if you disagree with them, at least hear them out. If you try to restrict others from expressing their thoughts, they will grow resentful.
Previous errors and oversights in business dealings are uncovered. Now that you realise why some arrangements aren’t going as well as expected you will do what is necessary to put things right. By evening you will experience the peace of mind you’ve been longing for.
It's not about showing off, but you certainly have reasons to feel proud of your achievements. At the same time, remember that not everyone around you shares your excitement and some may feel envious instead. So, why stir up negativity by provoking those feelings?
