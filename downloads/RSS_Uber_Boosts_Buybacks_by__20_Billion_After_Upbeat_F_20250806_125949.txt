Tech Earnings:
Uber Technologies Inc. on Wednesday announced $20 billion in new stock buybacks after sharing a better-than-expected third-quarter forecast and quarterly results, suggesting that growth at its core rideshare and delivery units still has room to pick up steam.
The company cited increased user frequency and said it has an opportunity to reach more consumers by cross-selling its rideshare and delivery services and adapting them to a wider range of customer needs. The gross bookings forecast for the current period represents an 18% to 21% growth rate, according to Bloomberg calculations, faster than the 17% gain in second-quarter bookings.
