Taiwan is preparing to restrict the import of Chinese-branded vehicles from third countries, following local media reports that BYD Co. is planning to enter the Taiwanese market by shipping cars assembled in Thailand.
“Based on considerations of national security, vehicle safety, information security and industrial development, the government will strictly prevent Chinese-branded automobiles from entering the Taiwanese market through various channels,” Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday.
