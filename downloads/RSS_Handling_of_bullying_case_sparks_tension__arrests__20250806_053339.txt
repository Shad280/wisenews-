Public outrage over alleged bullying video, rumours of favouritism and deployment of Swat officers lead to confrontation
The handling of a school bullying case by local authorities in a southwestern Chinese city has sparked outrage among locals, according to residents and mainland media, leading to police arrests for “blocking traffic”.
Chinese outlet iFeng.com posted a video on its social media account showing hundreds of people gathering inside a government building in Jiangyou, Sichuan province, on Monday to help the parents of a teenager who had been bullied at school negotiate with officials and express their dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of the incident.
The Public Security Bureau of Mianyang city, which administers Jiangyou, told the Guangzhou-based Yangcheng Evening News it had detained people who were “blocking traffic and refusing to heed police warnings” on Monday.
The South China Morning Post has contacted both Jiangyou and Mianyang police for comment.
The residents’ anger erupted after news went viral about a campus bullying case which locals believed was not dealt with fairly.
On Monday, following widespread public outrage over a video purportedly showing a girl being bullied by three others, police in Jiangyou said two teenage girls had been detained at a reformatory institution for allegedly assaulting and verbally abusing a 14-year-old girl.
