Tech Earnings:
Nvidia Corp.’s main server assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.’s sales growth slowed in July compared to previous few months, signaling that tariff-induced uncertainties are affecting electronics demand.
Sales rose 7.25% to NT$613.8 billion ($20.5 billion), its slowest growth since January. Analysts were looking for a 12.2% increase in third-quarter revenue. Hon Hai, which also assembles Apple Inc.’s iPhones, previously said it expects third-quarter sales to grow sequentially and year-on-year.
