The issue of Singapore-registered car owners who have pumped subsidised petrol across the Causeway is a sore point for Malaysians
An incident involving a Singapore-registered car owner who is seen filling up a plastic container with subsidised petrol in Malaysia on social media has prompted Malaysian authorities to launch an investigation.
The driver of the Mini Cooper with Singapore number plates was spotted at the Caltex Nusa Sentral station in Johor state on Sunday, filling up his car with RON 95-grade petrol and pumping it into a container for tapau, a colloquial term meaning a takeaway, according to one post on SG Road Vigilante.
RON 95 is a subsidised grade of petrol available for sale only to Malaysian-registered vehicles. It costs 2.05 ringgit (48 US cents) per litre (1⁄4 gallon), which is about five times lower than the price of similar-grade fuel in Singapore, according to Singapore news sites.
Online users have derided the driver in the post for being a cheapskate.
One user said: “As a Singaporean, I really feel totally embarrassed by this stupid [fellow] who can afford a Mini Cooper and yet pump RON 95.”
Others have tagged the official pages of the police on both sides of the Causeway, as well as Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority in their comments.
On Monday, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living (KPDN) Johor confirmed it had launched an investigation.
