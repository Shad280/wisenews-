Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter is flying to Washington on Tuesday in a last-minute bid for a deal to lower the 39% tariff imposed last week by Donald Trump.
The trip is to “facilitate meetings with the US authorities at short notice and hold talks,” the government said in a statementBloomberg Terminal. Underscoring the pressure the Swiss president is under at home, she is flying to DC without a formal invite from the White House to meet with Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter. Her office declined to comment on whom she plans to meet and what trade concessions she might bring before Thursday’s deadline to implement the levy.
