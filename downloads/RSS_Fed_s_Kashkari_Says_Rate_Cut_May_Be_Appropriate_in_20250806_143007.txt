Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said a slowing of the US economy may make an interest-rate cut appropriate in the near term, and he still sees two cuts by year’s end.
“The economy is slowing,” Kashkari said Wednesday in an interview with CNBC. “In the near term it may become appropriate to start adjusting the federal funds rate,” he said referring to the central bank’s benchmark rate.
