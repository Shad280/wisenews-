Here is a glimpse of the kind of information you can look forward to receiving at each of these historic sites.\nStonewall National Monument: One of the best places to admire the abundant natural beauty of New York City. The taxis, yellow. The skyscrapers, high! The luminous walk signs, with their flashing white gentleman composed of tiny stars, majestic! Here a community rose up in response to a police raid and sparked a revolution. We cannot say which community, but we hope there weren’t any LGBTQ people present. It seems unlikely; they did not exist before 1967, which was one of many things that made America Great at that time, and which we are trying our best to replicate today. We’ve been removing the movement’s patrons from the Stonewall website one letter at a time and seeing whether anyone notices.\nManzanar National Historic Site: This well-preserved internment-camp site from World War II is a chilling, gut-wrenching reminder of the stunning natural beauty of our flawless nation!\nMount Rushmore National Memorial: This incomplete statue of some presidents will be a wonderful place to contemplate America’s beauty soon, when it is beautified even further by the addition of the best president yet! We don’t need to say anything more about this site. Nice, uncontroversial place for some sculptures of white men, we’re pretty sure!\nLittle Rock Central High School National Historic Site: The National Guard liked this high school so much that it decided to sit in on classes here for a time in the 1960s. For some reason, only nine of the students who went here are singled out as heroes, but we think, actually, every student is a hero.\nRedwood National and State Parks: These beautiful, large trees are big enough to fend for themselves, and the implication that action is needed on our part to protect them is, frankly, insulting. Trees eat carbon dioxide, you know!!!\nAdams National Historic Park: President John Adams presided over the passage of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798! A great thing. Good legacy.\nSelma to Montgomery National Historic Trail: Some really scenic sights along here. Great place to hear birds. John Lewis marched across a bridge on this route, and some police marched out to meet him. Fun!\nTuskegee Airmen National Historic Site: This site was set aside to commemorate a bunch of people who have been removed from Air Force training materials, so we are unsure what they did. As soon as these people are added back to the training materials, we can tell you! Just keep in mind that if it appears that any of the people who participated in United States history weren’t white, that is DEI.\nHarriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park: This woman is famous for some reason, but we can’t say for sure what that is. Maybe the rare natural splendor of the surroundings of her home. Sometimes she led fellow Americans on long treks on foot, presumably to admire the breathtaking beauty of the environment up close. She did this many times. She must have loved nature!\nGettysburg National Military Park: It appears that lots of brave men fought and died here, but for what reason, we can’t exactly say. Not for us to take sides! We’ll refer you to President Donald Trump’s thoughts: “Gettysburg, what an unbelievable battle that was. It was so much and so interesting and so vicious and horrible and so beautiful in so many different ways; it represented such a big portion of the success of this country. Gettysburg, wow. I go to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to look and to watch. And, uh, the statement of Robert E. Lee, who’s no longer in favor, did you ever notice that? No longer in favor. ‘Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill.’ They were fighting uphill. He said, ‘Wow, that was a big mistake.’ He lost his great general. And they were fighting. ‘Never fight uphill, me boys!’ But it was too late.”\nThis is what happened here, and we hope you have no further questions.\nWomen’s Rights National Historic Park (Seneca Falls): Here a bunch of women got together and asked for something they did not really need! Most important: There’s a waterfall nearby.\nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Park: Here was born a president who did something that was important to do, and especially at that time. One of the lesser presidents, he came to guide the nation through the Civil War, which was fought over nothing. The Seinfeld of wars.\nTrail of Tears National Historic Trail: This scenic route takes you through nine states, starting in Georgia and continuing to Oklahoma! Along this path, you can see a lot of foliage. A fun trail to walk voluntarily.\nReconstruction Era National Historic Park: Things have always been good in this country. Look—a bird. Wow! Check out all the waterfowl around here!\nBoston National Historic Park (Freedom Trail): To describe the historic significance of this site would require us to disparage King George III of England. Which we are loath to do!

    "title": "The Quality Of Data Is Not Strained 20250804 061422",
    "content": "By Peter Tchir of Academy Securities\nIt is twice blest;\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\nPlease forgive the Shakespearean indulgence, but I’m in Waterloo, in Wellington Country, not too far from the Shakespeare festival in Stratford on the Avon (the Canadian version).\nBut finally, literally everyone is talking about a long-running theme in T-Reports – we need high quality data to make good decisions.\nI’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve written or spoken the words “Garbage In, Garbage Out” but it is a real issue with real world consequences.\nWe didn’t get to talk much about jobs in Tuesday’s Bloomberg TV interview, but we did get to talk about the balancing act of Tariffs vs. National Production for National Security and the importance the strike on Iran has had on U.S. relations with our allies.\nWhile we won’t focus on it today, the court rulings on the legality of existing tariffs could impact markets.\nOur Geopolitical Intelligence Group crafted a report on the announcement that the U.S. is moving two nuclear subs, which spooked markets, but is another example of some steps, that while potentially dangerous, are necessary in reestablishing deterrence and building Peace through Strength (see SITREP).\nImagine an “Alternate Reality” July 3rd\nImagine that on July 3rd, we had a June NFP headline of 14,000 jobs instead of 147,000.\nLet’s further imagine that May’s reported number was 19k, instead of whatever had been reported at the time.\nIt is easy if you try, since ADP was -23k and 29k respectively (why the markets and the Fed consistently ignore ADP is beyond me, but that is an argument for another day).\nIf we had that jobs data, would this FOMC been different?\nMaybe we wouldn’t have gotten a cut, but why the heck not? We had 2 dissents as it was. With this No Silver Lining Jobs Data, there would have been a lot of pressure to cut. The unemployment rate, which hasn’t been bad, has largely been stable because we have seen a 0.4% reduction in the labor force participation rate since April.\nCertainly, my flight back from London would have been more enjoyable as the data would have been even worse than my already pessimistic views and Treasuries could have continued their strong performance. It isn’t just our view that was hit by data that now looks very incorrect. On the July print, if memory serves, only 1 economist surveyed had an estimate that was higher. Now, it looks like in hindsight, that every estimate was above the actual number (though closer on average to the original print).\nThe real-world impact of having inaccurate data is problematic (and let’s be honest, for all we know this month’s data will be revised higher next month – which doesn’t change the argument that Garbage In, Garbage Out needs to be addressed).\nWe have often made well-reasoned arguments (some would say, rants) around incorrect inflation data. The owners’ equivalent rent is fraught with issues, including significant lag time. We’ve argued that the country voted based on the inflation they saw in the real world, not the calculated inflation (which seemed low on many things – like health insurance costs). Many look to things like Truflation to get potentially more accurate, real-time information (though not sure what good it does, if policy makers don’t).\nThe jobs data has caught everyone’s attention, it is time to address data across the board.\nLet’s not forget we live in an electronic and AI world, which should help us get better answers.\nThe Collection Problem.\nThe Seasonal Adjustment Problem.\nSo, we have all these incredibly smart, well-resourced economists trying to do 1 of 2 things:\nWhile “similar” the two things are very different.\nThe first is a truly valid exercise in establishing where the economy stands and providing data to make good decisions. Despite that, it is somewhat useless if no one believes you and just gravitates to the officially published data.\nThe second is what makes careers. Bloomberg reports analysts that are most “accurate.” Not accurate in terms of what the final data comes in at, but at predicting the pseudo random number that comes out the first Friday of the month (or other dates, for other data series).\nMy bet gravitates towards the crowd-sourced efforts of economists trying to predict the actual state of the economy (though I’m not sure if that is the goal of many, or trying to guess the NFP is the goal, which is similar but different).\nEnough ranting and rehashing old arguments. Let’s take a peek at some potential solutions, or at least some ideas that we think warrant discussion.\nGetting the most accurate, timely data as possible.\nEvery year, our employers send the IRS our tax forms, that include our income and our Social Security, so the IRS can link all of our employment income together. W2s and 1099s have to cover a significant part of the legal work force. Maybe I’m wrong, but I would expect that W2s and 1099s would cover a large percentage of the legal, documented workforce. It misses under the table payments, all cash jobs, and probably some sole proprietorship jobs, but virtually everyone I know receives at least 1 paycheck a month (some are weekly, or biweekly).\nSo how about providing some “encouragement” for companies to provide that information every month?\nJust imagine a world where on the 20th of each month (just to pick a date) anyone cutting checks that will show up on W2 or 1099 reports, sends (in an identical format) the information to the data collection area (probably involving the IRS, as they are the ones already entitled to this information on an annual basis).\nThat data is plunked into an algo that then comes up with changes in employment.\nWould we be missing some parts of the economy? Sure. Without a doubt. But would we have highly accurate information on the vast majority of the economy? Probably. This part of the jobs report could be published as such. Then we can all try to spend time figuring out what is happening in the part of the economy that is not captured.\nAgain, I’m not advocating for giving up our privacy, but the reality is that the information goes to the government, just not in this organized or frequent type of approach. I presume companies or payroll companies could code this additional step in a matter of weeks. Yes, maybe I’m missing a lot of legal issues, but can this really be worse than a survey?\nI would also like to see some “cohort” analysis. What I like about Case-Schiller is that it tracks a set of houses, not every house. There is effectively a “control” group. For wage inflation, it would be great to see data by cohort. Track the wage of a particular person over time. When we think about wage inflation, we think about what people get paid over time. This sort of methodology would mimic that. It could also potentially be done by income bracket (now this might be going too far, but just tossing it out there). What we currently get on average hourly earnings is a change in the entire pool of workers. But if someone retires and is replaced by a new employee at a much lower wage, the current methodology would likely see lower wage inflation than there really is. Tracking by cohorts over time may give a better read on wage pressures than existing methodologies. This is a second order effect, but hey, why not try to make a really robust report?\nOpen source the seasonality. Let’s publish both the unadjusted number (as volatile as that is) along with the adjusted number and the algorithm used to do that adjustment. Then the brightest or most curious minds can try to improve it. In this day and age, I wouldn’t bet against a group of kids in college playing around with the methodology and figuring out improvements – especially if we have reduced the range of issues around the data collection.\nWhether or not these ideas make any sense, there should be some simple steps taken.\nFinally, and this might sound weird, stop pretending that the data is accurate to the nth degree.\nImagine having only a yard stick with no measurements marked in between. Then being asked to use that yardstick to measure a long distance over a hilly, rocky field. You take that yardstick and to the best of your ability, flip it over and over, counting the number of flips until you have traversed the field.\nThen you come with an answer of 3,423 yards and 12 inches. There is no way the methodology laid out can produce something to that degree of accuracy. Maybe you could say that given the terrain, slippage, etc., we estimate between 3,400 and 3,500 yards, which isn’t as satisfying as 3,423 yards and 12 inches, but does convey a more accurate assessment of the situation. Significant figures exist in science for a reason, to avoid creating the perception of more accuracy than there really is. Maybe more of our economic data should incorporate that concept?\nMaybe we need a warning note along with the data?\nWe are getting warnings about almost everything these days. Objects in the mirror might be closer than they appear. Not eating fully cooked food. You get the idea.\nMaybe the warning label should be:\nBefore using this data, the margin for error is 136,000 for the Establishment Survey. Yes, the margin for error is larger, in some cases, than the actual number we report. Please rely on this data at your own risk as it may or may not be accurate, may be changed multiple times in the coming months, and again in annual revisions. If you think that is a wide margin of error, then we warn you not to even think about the margin for error in the Household Survey. BLS Technical Notes.\nI do not believe that the BLS intentionally gets anything wrong in either direction, but I do believe that in an era with so much of the data floating around electronically and the ability to apply hardcore computing power to that, we should be reinventing our data collection and publication tools to the greatest extent possible (I would include inflation and other important metrics in this project).\nI do not like the idea of “shooting the messenger” as that doesn’t create the goal of true intellectual honesty in developing new and better tools.\nGarbage In, Garbage Out should no longer be acceptable, and we should be able to corral the will and the resources to mitigate that risk.\nEnd rant, and have a great weekend!\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\nAdvertising: Contact Us\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure.Here's our Cookie Policy.\nHow to report offensive comments\nNotice on Racial Discrimination.",

Only 12 migrants on board the ship survived the accident, according to the head of the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Yemen, Abdusattor Esoev.\nEsoev added that the bodies of 54 migrants washed ashore in the district of Khanfar. 14 others were found dead and taken to a hospital morgue in Zinjibar, the provincial capital on Yemen’s southern coast.\nThe Abyan security directorate says a massive search and rescue operation is underway given the large number of dead and missing migrants. It noted that a large amount of dead bodies have already been retrieved after being found scattered across a wide area of the shore.\nYemen is still a major route for migrants from East and the Horn of Africa trying to reach Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries for work, despite a crippling civil war spanning more than a decade.\nMigrants are often taken on dangerous and overcrowded vessels by smugglers and travel across the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden. In recent months, the UN has verified that hundreds of African migrants lost their lives making these dangerous trips.\nIn March, two people were confirmed dead and 186 others missing after four boats carrying hundreds of migrants capsized off the coasts of Yemen and Djibouti, according to the IOM.\nIn 2024, more than 60,000 African migrants arrived in Yemen, an approximately 38% decrease from 2023 figures which surpassed 97,000. The IOM says the decrease is attributed to greater patrolling of the waters by Yemeni and regional authorities.\nAdditional sources • AP\nBrowse today's tags",

    "title": "The Weak Dollar is Making a European Vacation Hard 20250804 061433",
    "content": "Save up to 74%\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\nTravel pros explain how you can afford a European vacation in retirement, despite a weak dollar.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\nMany people dream of traveling extensively in retirement. Europe tends to be a popular destination, in part because many countries are easily accessible to one another. Europe boasts a sophisticated railway system, allowing retirees (and travelers in general) to take a single flight and visit multiple countries. And when the dollar is strong, a European vacation could, in some cases, be more economical than traveling domestically, especially during peak seasons.\nBut that’s not the case today. The Wall Street Journal says that the dollar’s decline during the first half of the year against peer currencies was the steepest in more than half a century. And it so happens that the dollar is down 13% against the euro, making it harder for retirees to travel abroad.\nIf you’re a retiree who was hoping to take a European vacation this year, you may be running into issues with what you can afford. But that doesn’t mean you have to abandon your plans completely.\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\nEuropean hotspots like Italy, Spain, and France tend to be expensive even when the dollar is stronger. If you’re a retiree with a limited travel budget, given current circumstances, you may want to consider visiting less-traveled corners of Europe. Not only might your money go further, but you might benefit from there being fewer crowds.\nKendra Guild, VP of North America at Solos Holidays, a tour operator that arranges group tours for solo travelers with a particular focus on people 50 and over, says, “We’re definitely seeing how economic uncertainty is reshaping summer travel plans this year. People still want to get away, maybe more than ever, but there’s more hesitation around making big financial commitments.”\nGuild says one way travelers are pivoting is sticking to their top destinations but taking shorter trips that are more affordable. If you’re willing to pack in a lot of sightseeing, shortening a trip means spending less on lodging and food while you’re abroad. That could produce considerable savings.\nGuild also says travelers to Europe are now more open to new destinations.\n“We’re also seeing a shift in destination demand,” she says. “There’s growing interest in more off-the-beaten-path regions like Umbria or Puglia in Italy, the Alsace region in France, lesser-known islands and the mainland in Greece, and the Baltics. These destinations offer incredible food, history, culture, and scenery — but at a slower pace, often with fewer crowds and a lower price tag.”\nGuild says she’s also seeing a lot of interest in Albania.\n“The country boasts diverse landscapes, from beautiful beaches along the Ionian and Adriatic Seas to the rugged mountains of the Albanian Alps. Its affordability makes it an approachable destination to enjoy the best of the Adriatic Sea at significantly lower prices than neighboring Greece.”\nIt’s easy to get stuck on a specific vision for a European vacation. But with a weaker dollar, you may need to get creative, says Domenick D’Andrea, Co-Founder and Financial Advisor at DanDarah Wealth Management.\nOne thing he suggests is traveling at off-peak times during the year. That way, he says, “You may be able to get back on budget and still have your dream vacation.”\nD’Andrea also suggests reassessing your lodging options. A hotel might seem optimal, but renting an Airbnb with a fully stocked kitchen could not only be cheaper on a nightly basis, but help you save money on food costs while you’re away.\nAdditionally, if you’re willing to do some research and get familiar with local public transportation, you may be able to save money by exploring different cities and attractions on your own rather than paying for a tour.\n“There are many free excursions in Europe,” D’Andrea says. “You could also find local restaurants instead of the tourist traps.”\nA European getaway might seem undoable right now. And you may be inclined to put off your dream trip because of it.\nYou definitely don’t want to strain your finances or incur debt to take a big trip, D’Andrea says. But do remember that good health is never guaranteed. So instead of giving up on Europe, there may be a way to make things work.\n“If you still want to have the trip that you have always planned for, and it is still over budget, I suggest sitting down with your financial advisor to see if you can move things around,” D’Andrea says. “This could mean that maybe next year you don’t travel, or you cut back on some other expenses.”\nAlso, D’Andrea says, don’t write off the option of boosting your income.\n“Maybe get a part-time job to help make up the difference,” he says.\nIt’s hard to know when the dollar will regain its strength, and when Europe will become more affordable for U.S. travelers to visit. If you’re in good enough health to take the trip now, then it may be worth making other sacrifices to pull it off.\nAs D’Andrea says, “With proper planning, research, and working with the right professionals, you can find a way to make it work.”\nProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.

She laced a thread from each hole to the one opposite, covering the card with lines that crossed in the middle. When she tried connecting each hole to one not exactly opposite, she was delighted to find the threads left a symmetric curve in the middle of the card. She felt this activity gave her an intuition that helped her learn formal geometry.\nYears later, in 1864, she was widowed with five children. Even though the academic system didn’t value the contributions of women, she worked as a librarian and maths tutor in London.\nBoole thought children should be given mathematical objects, such as her curve-stitching activities, to play with to help them develop their understanding. She linked mathematical imagination and creativity in other ways, including explaining logic and algebra using fable and history.\nNow you can play, too, by making a “string art” image inspired by her work, in which you draw lines instead of threading them. Draw a pair of horizontal and vertical axes 10 centimetres long, marking the numbers 1 to 10 on each line, 1 cm apart. Now draw a straight line from point 1 on the horizontal axis to point 10 on the vertical. Then connect 2 to 9, 3 to 8, and so on. Even though each line is straight, a curve should start to appear, as the straight lines are all tangent to the curve.\nYou may have used drawing software, where the shape of a path can be controlled by setting its two end points and a third point that controls how much it bends. These are Bézier curves, now used widely in computer-aided design. They are related to Boole’s early stitched curve, with the curve fixed by the end of the axes and the point where they cross.\nAfter some practice, you should be able to draw the lines without numbering the marks – and try using different colours for them. She recommended it as a stitching exercise rather than a drawing one, especially for young children, because it is easier to stitch a straight line than to draw one. You can use thread: just replace dots with holes.\nAs with any mathematical concept, this idea is open to exploration.

Photo / Thinkstock\nThousands of KiwiSaver members are at risk of potentially facing a hefty tax bill if they switch to another scheme - and some may know nothing about it.\nPeople who have transferred pension savings from the United Kingdom to their New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme could be taxed up to 55\nper cent of that money if they switch to another KiwiSaver scheme.\nThat's because KiwiSaver schemes are no longer on the list of qualifying overseas pension schemes issued by UK tax department HM Revenue and Customs.\nAround 20 KiwiSaver schemes were dropped from the list in April in a move which took the industry by surprise and has left savers practically trapped in their current scheme.\nThe schemes were dropped because KiwiSaver allows people to access their money before the age of 55 to buy their first home or through financial hardship.\nREAD MORE:• KiwiSaver transfer could trigger hefty tax bill• Mary Holm: Can I have more than one super scheme?• Kiwisaver: If you're in trouble, you need proof\nIf savers try to move their money it could trigger a 40 per cent tax for an unauthorised payment charge and a further 15 per cent payment surcharge because no KiwiSaver schemes are currently eligible to accept UK pension money.\nThe move also means Kiwis returning from a British OE and new British immigrants can not transfer any UK pension money into KiwiSaver, although they can put the money into a non-KiwiSaver qualifying superannuation scheme in New Zealand.\nProviders were made aware of the change in April and have taken a mixed approach to telling members.\nTherese Singleton, GM Investments and Insurance at AMP said it had not directly communicated the current position with all of its UK pension transfer customers as it had had \"very little interest\" from those customers looking to transfer their funds.\n\"In the very small number of cases looking to transfer we have provided full transparent information to clients to support their decisions.\"\n*The numbers supplied are from the biggest KiwiSaver providers which accepted UK pension transfers. ASB, ANZ, BNZ, Mercer were not on the list of qualifying overseas pension schemes. AMP numbers are to the year ended March 31. Westpac and Kiwi Wealth numbers are aproximate.\nMilford managing director Antony Quirk said it had adopted a case-by-case approach to transfers communicating on the basis of individual circumstances.\nIt had yet to have an affected member apply to switch to another scheme but had a protocol in preparation for it.\n\"Where a switch is initiated and we believe it could create a tax liability, we will inform the client and suggest they take appropriate advice.\"\nGrosvenor head of sales and marketing Diana Papadopoulos said as it worked mainly though financial advisers it had kept the advisers up to date.\n\"As the implications of the UK changes have unfolded, we've been in regular communication with our advisers to ensure they're able to inform their clients.\"\nA Kiwi Wealth spokeswoman said it had notified all immediately affected members - those who were in the process of transferring money when the change came in and those who had applied to transfer it after April 6 - urging them to get independent tax advice.\nIt had also placed information on its website for other members and updated its investment statement.\nBut the situation has already resulted in some savers having to back-pedal after trying to switch to another scheme.\nThe prohibition of transfers between KiwiSaver schemes is the key area of concern in this context, as it prevents a member exercising any choice of new scheme.\nIn a letter to commerce minister Paul Goldsmith KiwiSaver industry body Workplace Savings said the situation was \"giving rise to mistakes (and forced unwinds) in terms of transfers between the schemes, and some increasing frustration on the part of affected members and providers.\"\n\"The prohibition of transfers between KiwiSaver schemes is the key area of concern in thiscontext, as it prevents a member exercising any choice of new scheme,\" executive director Bruce Kerr wrote.\nThe body also warned the transfer problem might inhibit scheme mergers and wind-ups.\nLast week the NZX wrote to investors in its Smartshares KiwiSaver scheme proposing to move them across to the SuperLife KiwiSaver scheme, both of which it manages.\nBut it told 12 of the 1350 members they could not be moved without risking the tax liability on their UK pension money which they had transferred to their New Zealand KiwiSaver account.\nThe bulk transfer is the first to occur involving UK pension money since the April change and has yet to gain approval from regulator the Financial Markets Authority.\nWorkplace Savings has urged the government to act quickly to resolve the issues.\n\"We request, on behalf of all affected KiwiSaver scheme managers, that these issues now be addressed as soon as practicable,\" Kerr wrote.\nCommerce minister Paul Goldsmith said New Zealand's tax department was examining potential options to address the issue and were engaging closely with revenue and customs officials in the UK.\n\"Currently there is no set timeframe for reaching a solution. However, officials are aware of the importance of solving this issue and are giving it a high priority.\"\nGoldsmith said ultimately it was up to Kiwisaver providers to ensure their members were aware of issues affecting them.\n\"However, I would encourage all providers to take a proactive and open approach in communicating with their members.\"\nOPINION: There's lots to consider when there is no 'employer'.",

Westpac and Kiwi Wealth numbers are aproximate.\nMilford managing director Antony Quirk said it had adopted a case-by-case approach to transfers communicating on the basis of individual circumstances.\nIt had yet to have an affected member apply to switch to another scheme but had a protocol in preparation for it.\n\"Where a switch is initiated and we believe it could create a tax liability, we will inform the client and suggest they take appropriate advice.\"\nGrosvenor head of sales and marketing Diana Papadopoulos said as it worked mainly though financial advisers it had kept the advisers up to date.\n\"As the implications of the UK changes have unfolded, we've been in regular communication with our advisers to ensure they're able to inform their clients.\"\nA Kiwi Wealth spokeswoman said it had notified all immediately affected members - those who were in the process of transferring money when the change came in and those who had applied to transfer it after April 6 - urging them to get independent tax advice.\nIt had also placed information on its website for other members and updated its investment statement.\nBut the situation has already resulted in some savers having to back-pedal after trying to switch to another scheme.\nThe prohibition of transfers between KiwiSaver schemes is the key area of concern in this context, as it prevents a member exercising any choice of new scheme.\nIn a letter to commerce minister Paul Goldsmith KiwiSaver industry body Workplace Savings said the situation was \"giving rise to mistakes (and forced unwinds) in terms of transfers between the schemes, and some increasing frustration on the part of affected members and providers.\"\n\"The prohibition of transfers between KiwiSaver schemes is the key area of concern in thiscontext, as it prevents a member exercising any choice of new scheme,\" executive director Bruce Kerr wrote.\nThe body also warned the transfer problem might inhibit scheme mergers and wind-ups.\nLast week the NZX wrote to investors in its Smartshares KiwiSaver scheme proposing to move them across to the SuperLife KiwiSaver scheme, both of which it manages.\nBut it told 12 of the 1350 members they could not be moved without risking the tax liability on their UK pension money which they had transferred to their New Zealand KiwiSaver account.\nThe bulk transfer is the first to occur involving UK pension money since the April change and has yet to gain approval from regulator the Financial Markets Authority.\nWorkplace Savings has urged the government to act quickly to resolve the issues.\n\"We request, on behalf of all affected KiwiSaver scheme managers, that these issues now be addressed as soon as practicable,\" Kerr wrote.\nCommerce minister Paul Goldsmith said New Zealand's tax department was examining potential options to address the issue and were engaging closely with revenue and customs officials in the UK.\n\"Currently there is no set timeframe for reaching a solution. However, officials are aware of the importance of solving this issue and are giving it a high priority.\"\nGoldsmith said ultimately it was up to Kiwisaver providers to ensure their members were aware of issues affecting them.\n\"However, I would encourage all providers to take a proactive and open approach in communicating with their members.\"\nOPINION: There's lots to consider when there is no 'employer'.",

    "title": "Three Ways a Rally Ends   Only One Makes You Money 20250804 061426",
    "content": "What beach volleyball can teach you about smart investing…\nEditor’s Note: The Nasdaq and S&P aren’t far below all-time highs. Big Tech earnings, overall, are wowing Wall Street. And FOMO is rising.\nBut as we’ve seen before, not every rally ends well.\nToday, we’re turning over the Digest to our macro investing expert Eric Fry for a timely take on what’s unfolding in the markets.\nIn his essay below, Eric draws an unexpected – but surprisingly revealing – analogy between his decades playing beach volleyball in Southern California and navigating today’s investment landscape.\nYou’ll see why some stocks soaring right now may have run too far, too fast… why others are starting to break down mid-rally… and why only a select few have the fundamentals in place to deliver real, lasting gains.\nIf you want to avoid the AI hype stocks and find the companies with strong footing and room to run before their next earnings drop, today’s Digest is essential reading.\nEnough introduction. I’ll let Eric take it from here.\nHave a good weekend,\nJeff Remsburg\nI’m a native Southern Californian, so it probably won’t surprise you to hear that I’m an avid beach volleyball player.\nIn fact, I’ve been playing for decades, and spent my “crazy youth” of the 1980s at the volleyball nets ofCalifornia’s beaches.\nAlthough I have jokingly referred to the sport as my “real job,” the truth is that playing volleyball has similarities to playing the market, especially during a rally.\nLike the one we’re experiencing right now.\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both hit record highs during intraday trading. They started out even higher today largely due to optimism surrounding yesterday’s trade agreement between the United States and European Union\nThis upward trend may continue this week, as several big tech companies deliver earnings.\nWhile the “fear of missing out” may have you wanting to participate in this rally, you should still do so cautiously.\nHere’s what my time at the net has taught me about smart investing…\nBeach volleyball, like the markets, also consists of rallies. In the sandy game, though, a rally is the sequence of hits back and forth between teams during any given point.\nA volleyball rally always starts with a serve – and it ends in only one of three ways…\n1. The ball lands out of bounds.\nFrom an investing angle, you can think of this as companies with sky-high valuations. While these firms may seem attractive to investors, like Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), the truth is that their valuations are overshot, landing them in the stratosphere.\nFor instance, Nvidia’s market cap sits at $4.23 trillion, the highest in the world. It is currently trading for 56X its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, or about double the market average.\nI recommend avoiding out-of-bounds stocks like these because their high valuations yield to low valuations… eventually.\nInstead, you’ll want to focus on companies that land squarely within the winning parameters of the court. That is why I look for companies that have a promising runway built by strong fundamentals – attractive valuations.\nIn fact, I recommend one such company over Nvidia. And it is set to report its second quarter earnings for 2025 tomorrow, July 29. Analysts expect this company to beat estimates with over 20% year-over-year earnings growth and nearly 7% year-over-year revenue growth.\nYou can learn how to access all of the details about this company – before its earnings call – by clicking here.\nThis brings me to the second way a volleyball rally…\n2. A team commits a fault, like failing to return the ball over the net.\nYou can think of this as companies that miss the mark. Like Tesla Inc. (TSLA), as we talked about in last Saturday’s Smart Money.\nThe company announced last week that it missed both top and bottom lines for the second quarter of 2025. This is largely due to declining vehicle sales. CEO Elon Musk said that the company “probably could have a few rough quarters” ahead.\nWhat’s more, Tesla is well behind the pace needed to meet its stated goal of producing at least 5,000 Optimus robots this year. The company has so far only produced a few hundred.\nTesla is failing to return and is, therefore, not a stock that we want in our portfolios.\nI’ve got my eye instead on a company that is successfully sailing over the net. It’s a robotics company that is a direct competitor to Tesla, and its current backlog means there’s another $23 billion in future sales already baked in the cake. You can learn the name of this company, for free, here.\nOf course, the most favorable way to end a beach volleyball rally for the serving team is when…\n3. A point is scored.\nYou don’t have to be a beach volleyball fan, or even a sports fan in general, to know that scoring a point is the only way to win.\nOf course, as investors, we also want to “win” the rally.\nThe best way to do that is to play it right. You don’t want to stock up on overvalued or faulty companies. In fact, I recommend selling those types of stocks if they are in your portfolio right now.\nYou want to invest in the right stocks at the right time.\nThat’s why I’ve compiled a list of three companies that I believe are “Buys.” These are under-the-radar, early opportunities that can help you protect and multiply your money during make-or-break markets.\nYou can find the details of these companies – ticker symbols and all – in my brand-new special broadcast, free of charge.\nRegards,\nEric Fry\nEditor, Smart Money\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2025/08/three-ways-a-rally-ends-only-one-makes-you-money-2/.\n©2025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nHot Stocks\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nAll rights reserved.

    "content": "Medical News and Health News Blog\nEvery day, new health headlines flash across our screens—breakthrough cures, shocking dangers, miraculous “superfoods,” or even dire worldwide warnings. In a digital age where news goes viral in a matter of seconds, separating fact from fiction has never been more urgent or more challenging. Medical misinformation isn’t just a nuisance; it can have lifelong consequences for public health, personal choices, and trust in experts. Enter the era of medical fact-checking: a proactive, evolving effort to debunk, clarify, and democratize the truth behind viral health news stories.\nIn this article, we’ll explore how timeless medical fact-checking protects us from misinformation, showcase the newest tools (including the power of AI), and empower you to become a smarter news consumer. Along the way, we’ll feature pivotal topics, real-world case studies, ethical dilemmas, and the ways you can join this movement—no medical degree required.\nHave you ever wondered why so many “miracle cures” and “deadly new threats” keep popping up online? Viral health stories trade on emotion, urgency, and the natural human need to protect ourselves and loved ones. But unchecked, these stories can ignite real panic, prompt people to skip proven treatments, or even buy into risky, expensive fads.\nMedical fact-checking is the antidote. At its best, it’s a blend of rigorous science, clear communication, critical thinking, and community effort. It ensures that whether you’re reading about the latest “immunity booster” or a potential pandemic, you’re getting the information you need to make safe, smart decisions.\nLet’s unpack the major areas where fact-checking has a big impact on both professional and everyday readers.\nSome health myths just won’t quit—they resurface every few years, gaining momentum as they whirl through social media and news feeds. But why do they stick around? Viral myths are often simple, emotionally charged, or exploit current fears (“This fruit will cure cancer!” or “Vaccines cause dangerous side effects!”).\nHow Fact-Checking Works:\nResults? Well-executed medical fact-checking can dramatically reduce belief in dangerous falsehoods and improve public health literacy.\nFact-checking today isn’t just about dusty books and library research. It’s a high-tech field that blends old-school investigation with modern databases and digital platforms.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming almost every field—and medical fact-checking is no exception. AI is especially adept at flagging patterns, quickly reviewing large datasets, and comparing claims to established medical knowledge.\nBut there are limits:AI can only be as good as its data and programming.

Spotting a credible health news story (versus a clickbait fake) is a crucial skill for anyone who reads online.\nWhat should you look for?\nHealthcare professionals play a vital role in validating information—but you can learn to spot red flags, too.\nFact-checkers face difficulties too:\nSometimes, fact-checking succeeds so brilliantly it changes lives—or even public policy. Real-world examples put principles into practice:\nFact-checkers can’t do it alone! Public education, outreach, and engagement are vital for turning passive readers into active truth-seekers.\nHow to Make a Difference:\nFact-checking must walk a delicate line: we need to be transparent and thorough, but also respectful of privacy, freedom of expression, and nuance.\nNo one person—or even one organization—can police every health claim. Trusted networks foster collaboration, innovation, and public confidence.\nNetwork Principles:\n1. How can I identify trustworthy medical fact-checking sources?Look for credentials, cited sources, transparent review processes, and organizations that are independent or part of journalistic/medical partnerships.\n2. What role does AI play in verifying medical news stories?AI is great for scaling up claim detection, scanning research, and identifying patterns, but always requires expert human review before public guidance.\n3. How do social media platforms handle viral health misinformation?They use a mix of AI, community flagging, warning labels, and sometimes content moderation—with varied success and ongoing debate.\n4. What are the most common viral health myths debunked recently?Topics like “miracle virus cures,” vaccine safety myths, “natural” cancer treatments, and fad diets top the frequent-flyer list for medical fact-checkers.\n5. How reliable are automated medical fact-checking tools?They’re improving fast but not yet a replacement for medically trained experts. Use them as a starting point, not a final verdict.\n6.

How can I contribute to medical fact-checking efforts?Share reputable information, report suspicious claims, participate in local educational efforts, or volunteer with a fact-checking group.\n8. Is there a network or community for medical fact-checkers?Yes! Many organizations now support training, standards, and recognition for dedicated fact-checkers—both professionals and volunteers.\n9. How do fact-checkers balance transparency with privacy concerns?By redacting personal info, anonymizing sensitive cases, and sticking to guidelines that protect individuals without hiding the truth.\n10. What impact does medical fact-checking have on public health behavior?High-quality, timely fact-checking has been shown to reduce misinformation belief, boost evidence-based decision making, and improve public trust in medicine.\nYou don’t need special training to make a difference.

    "title": "Today s AI Could Make Pandemics 5 Times More Likel 20250804 052330",
    "content": "Correspondent\nCorrespondent\nRecent developments in AI could mean that human-caused pandemics are five times more likely than they were just a year ago, according to a study of top experts' predictions shared exclusively with TIME.\nThe data echoes concerns raised by AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic in recent months, both of which have warned that today’s AI tools are reaching the ability to meaningfully assist bad actors attempting to create bioweapons.\nRead More: Exclusive: New Claude Model Triggers Bio-Risk Safeguards at Anthropic\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIt has long been possible for biologists to modify viruses using laboratory technology. The new development is the ability for chatbots—like ChatGPT or Claude—to give accurate troubleshooting advice to amateur biologists trying to create a deadly bioweapon in a lab. Safety experts have long viewed the difficulty of this troubleshooting process as a significant bottleneck on the ability of terrorist groups to create a bioweapon, says Seth Donoughe, a co-author of the study. Now, he says, thanks to AI, the expertise necessary to intentionally cause a new pandemic “could become accessible to many, many more people.”\nBetween December 2024 and February 2025, the Forecasting Research Institute asked 46 biosecurity experts and 22 “superforecasters” (individuals with a high success rate at predicting future events) to estimate the risk of a human-caused pandemic. The average survey respondent predicted the risk of that happening in any given year was 0.3%.\nAdvertisement\nCrucially, the surveyors then asked another question: how much would that risk increase if AI tools could match the performance of a team of experts on a difficult virology troubleshooting test? If AI could do that, the average expert said, then the annual risk would jump to 1.5%—a fivefold increase.\nWhat the forecasters didn’t know was that Donoughe, a research scientist at the pandemic prevention nonprofit SecureBio, was testing AI systems for that very capability.

    "content": "It's Monday, August 4, and one star sign has been working a little too hard, while another experiences a surge in emotional and physical energy.\nThere are 12 zodiac signs - Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces - and the horoscopes for each can give you the lowdown on what your future holds, be it in work, your love life, your friends and family or more.\nThese daily forecasts have been compiled by astrologer Russell Grant, who has been reading star signs for over 50 years. From Aries through to Pisces, here's what today could bring for your horoscope - and what you can do to be prepared.\nCelebrate your accomplishments as you have achieved a lot since the year began. Everything you are hoping for is likely to manifest. Your partner will amaze you with their honesty and warmth. Expect a boost in your career that will leave you pleasantly surprised\nYou have a great opportunity to acquire something valuable and luxurious that you have been wanting for some time. The best part is that despite the cost, this will not jeopardise your financial stability. So why wait? Make that special purchase now.\nRecent struggles in both business and personal relationships can be left behind. You are on the brink of a positive transformation and nothing can hold you back. How should you handle this emotional high? You need some time to yourself to take it all in.\nProjects that allow you to work alone will go smoothly. Conversely, the charged atmosphere when you get together with others will make you uneasy. If you avoid stirring up conflict and are able to keep your emotions in check you should enjoy a calm end to the day.\nYou’ve been working hard but maybe too hard as this is starting to take its toll on your health. Stress, insufficient sleep and ongoing fatigue will lead to irritability and a lack of patience with others. To avoid becoming overwhelmed, allow yourself some much-needed time to rest.\nIt will feel like a coincidence when someone who is on your mind calls you or gets in touch through a social networking site. This person once held a special place in your life. A party invitation presents a wonderful opportunity to rekindle bonds with friends who were once very dear to you.\nYou won’t mind having to set aside your own responsibilities to help someone in need. This is just as well as you will soon receive a call from a friend seeking your guidance and support. With your natural altruism, you will respond quickly to their request for help.\nPeople admire your skills and this makes you stand out among peers and colleagues. Your superiors appreciate your business mindset and you are seen as a valuable member of the team. So what’s holding you back from discussing a rise in salary with management?\nOnce more you get a chance to showcase your remarkable strengths. You shine as a capable leader, exceptional thinker and someone with a unique perspective on business. By this evening, you will have another achievement to celebrate with your family.\nA surge in emotional and physical energy will prompt you to act on ideas you have been considering recently. A lot is likely to get done while you are in such high spirits. The end of the day is favourable for re-assessing your values and setting new priorities that promote continued progress.\nYou get on well with everyone. In fact, you enjoy mixing with people from all walks of life. This enables you to encourage a group of diverse characters to find a common ground. No one expected a project to be so successful and this is all due to your positive contribution.\nYou need to make better choices when it comes to your health and daily habits. It’s essential to get a minimum of eight hours of sleep each night. Balance your work with leisure and follow a nutritious diet. A lack of energy should not be overlooked as your well-being will influence the success of ongoing projects.\nAt  Reach and across our entities  we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

    "content": "LOGIN\nI love science fiction movies and series. But what always bothered me was that as imaginative, forward-thinking, inventive and superlatively intelligent as the worlds and multiple universes they created, it was no match for the diversity we have on Earth and humankind.\nEven my current favourite Apple TV+’s Foundation, based on the genius Isaac Asimov’s 1950s book series, cannot create a world or planet as diverse as ours. Generally speaking, movies and TV series have just one type of people per planet. Indeed, a planet is often a single city.\nWhen I read politics and philosophy at university, I was introduced to Douglas Adams and his amazing book series The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the “trilogy in four parts”. It was through Adams’ Hitchhiker’s books that I began to recognise the lessons I had been picking up from Star Trek and Star Wars movies.\nAll the stories involved good fighting against an overwhelming evil power, while they try to build a new society that is based on equality and freedom. There are obvious comparisons to South Africa’s resistance against the apartheid government and military.\nBut some of the greatest minds cannot imagine a world as diverse as Earth’s or conjure up a species with a multitude of cultures, nationalities and peoples as the human race.\nIt is British-South African writer JRR Tolkien, in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, who is able to best reflect the many sides of humankind. In truth though, Tolkien’s books are fantasy and, strictly speaking, not sci-fi. But I like to think of fantasy and sci-fi as close cousins.\nAlthough Tolkien wrote the books during World War II, he strongly denied they were an allegory of that war. But it would not be incorrect to reflect that Tolkien’s experiences in World War II influenced his writing. So maybe the evil Sauron was not necessarily Hitler, but it is not too farfetched to relate Sauron’s evil purpose to build a world that serves him and over which he has complete control to the objectives of Nazi fascism.\nWe should not focus on the banal evil of Sauron or his minions, the Orcs. There have been articles accusing Tolkien of being racist in his descriptions of the Orcs. But thinking of the Orcs as black people is a cop-out and not a useful unpacking of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. It is in The Hobbit that Tolkien explores and describes the inequality of the world and how accepting we are of the inequality, despite supposedly fighting against it.\nIt is the experiences of the dwarfs and the difficulties they face that reflect our world; one in which those who have precious resources are made to mine them and hand them over to the elves so that they can rule the world forever.\nTolkien presents the elves as close to immortal and beautiful, almost God-like. The dwarfs are short and stumpy, nothing noble about them. They covet Earth’s riches, but do not know how to develop them. So it’s in the interests of all of Earth that the elves take these jewels to invent machinery and technology to make the world easier. But it requires the dwarfs to live in the dark, remain in the bowels of the mountains and mine the precious treasures.\nThe hobbits are of course, the simple rural and working class, who befriend the dwarfs and assist in creating a balance with their simple lives. Just when the opportunity of equality presents itself, the human penchant for greed takes over and this allows evil to reign.\nThe implication is clear: there can only be a semblance of equality. The elves rule (benevolently because they are naturally good, of course) and the dwarfs remain underground mining for the elves, while the rural and working class produce the goods and live in their Middle Earth. The elves like to say that if they are not revered and allowed to remain in charge then an evil Sauron will take over.\nOur world today is not very different to what Tolkien reflected upon.\nThe instability in the world is not fuelled by US President Donald Trump, even though he benefits from it. The real fear for our elves (the political West) is that if the current path is allowed to continue it will result in them no longer being in charge. In their understanding they cannot exist unless they have hegemonic control of the world; it is the natural order of things. For them, Russia and China are Sauron, and it is in our interests to reinforce the West so that the “evil” Russia and China do not take over.\nIf we look at our international multilateral system, we have to accept that even though it is stated that all countries are equal and sovereign, the multilateral institutions are deliberately created with structural inequalities. The obvious one is the United Nations, where it is only the UN Security Council that makes decisions that must be implemented. The resolutions of the UN General Assembly are ceremonial and no one is compelled to implement them. And the five permanent members of the UN Security Council possess a veto vote, which means all five must agree for a resolution to be passed.\nThe unequal power dynamic of the Security Council is generally catered for by creative means by all other multilateral institutions. Thus, the International Monetary Fund is always headed up by a European, who must be approved by the United States. The World Bank is always headed by an American. The International Criminal Court (ICC) must charge those the Security Council tells it to, even though not all the permanent members of the Security Council have ratified and signed the ICC’s Rome Statute. Essentially, the inequality is multiplied and reinforced.\nIt is impossible that these unequal relations could go on forever. But, just like the elves regarded themselves as immortal, in reality the West and its leaders cannot understand why they are not liked. French leaders find it weird that former French colonies would prefer Beijing over Paris. The legions of Western sympathisers in Central and South America, as well as Africa and parts of South East Asia, have a difficult time trying to understand why the masses would cheer Putin and Xi Jinping, but not get excited by Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.\nFor too long we have regarded a see-saw as balance. A see-saw is unbalanced or, at most, an uneasy balance, where one is higher and the other lower, only for the reverse to occur. If one remains on top, the other at the bottom need only to walk away for the one on top to be brought back down to earth. As Tolkien’s books reveal, we are made to believe that someone has to be on top or in charge for there to be stability and balance.  But that is not stability, that is dominance expressed as stability.\nOur three-legged potjie or four-legged chair is balance and stability. We need to reconstruct this world, so that it reflects not who is in charge or is the most powerful but rather how to ensure that everyone has a voice. Africa, together with Central and South America and parts of South East Asia, should not swop the dominance of the West for China, Russia and India. It is important that they join Brics, but they need to recreate the Non-Aligned Movement without India, Russia and China. They can provide Pakistan conditional membership because of its nuclear weapon capability. If Iran goes the nuclear route, they should also be treated in a similar manner.\nThe Gen-Z Non-Aligned Movement has to be different to its predecessors; it has to form a trade bloc. The non-nuclear political South has to either unite or accept that either the Western or Eastern elves remain in charge, and that we, like the dwarfs, must hide in the dark and only come out to praise them.\nDonovan E Williams is a social commentator. @TheSherpaZA on X.\nAbout\nContact\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nWhatsApp Channel\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\n\nTikTok\n\nThreads\n200 Young South Africans\nPower Of Women\nGreening The Future\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nEthics & Social Media Policy\nMail & Guardian Careers\nProperty for sale\n© 2025 The Mail & Guardian.

So maybe the evil Sauron was not necessarily Hitler, but it is not too farfetched to relate Sauron’s evil purpose to build a world that serves him and over which he has complete control to the objectives of Nazi fascism.\nWe should not focus on the banal evil of Sauron or his minions, the Orcs. There have been articles accusing Tolkien of being racist in his descriptions of the Orcs. But thinking of the Orcs as black people is a cop-out and not a useful unpacking of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. It is in The Hobbit that Tolkien explores and describes the inequality of the world and how accepting we are of the inequality, despite supposedly fighting against it.\nIt is the experiences of the dwarfs and the difficulties they face that reflect our world; one in which those who have precious resources are made to mine them and hand them over to the elves so that they can rule the world forever.\nTolkien presents the elves as close to immortal and beautiful, almost God-like. The dwarfs are short and stumpy, nothing noble about them. They covet Earth’s riches, but do not know how to develop them. So it’s in the interests of all of Earth that the elves take these jewels to invent machinery and technology to make the world easier. But it requires the dwarfs to live in the dark, remain in the bowels of the mountains and mine the precious treasures.\nThe hobbits are of course, the simple rural and working class, who befriend the dwarfs and assist in creating a balance with their simple lives. Just when the opportunity of equality presents itself, the human penchant for greed takes over and this allows evil to reign.\nThe implication is clear: there can only be a semblance of equality. The elves rule (benevolently because they are naturally good, of course) and the dwarfs remain underground mining for the elves, while the rural and working class produce the goods and live in their Middle Earth. The elves like to say that if they are not revered and allowed to remain in charge then an evil Sauron will take over.\nOur world today is not very different to what Tolkien reflected upon.\nThe instability in the world is not fuelled by US President Donald Trump, even though he benefits from it. The real fear for our elves (the political West) is that if the current path is allowed to continue it will result in them no longer being in charge. In their understanding they cannot exist unless they have hegemonic control of the world; it is the natural order of things. For them, Russia and China are Sauron, and it is in our interests to reinforce the West so that the “evil” Russia and China do not take over.\nIf we look at our international multilateral system, we have to accept that even though it is stated that all countries are equal and sovereign, the multilateral institutions are deliberately created with structural inequalities. The obvious one is the United Nations, where it is only the UN Security Council that makes decisions that must be implemented. The resolutions of the UN General Assembly are ceremonial and no one is compelled to implement them. And the five permanent members of the UN Security Council possess a veto vote, which means all five must agree for a resolution to be passed.\nThe unequal power dynamic of the Security Council is generally catered for by creative means by all other multilateral institutions. Thus, the International Monetary Fund is always headed up by a European, who must be approved by the United States. The World Bank is always headed by an American. The International Criminal Court (ICC) must charge those the Security Council tells it to, even though not all the permanent members of the Security Council have ratified and signed the ICC’s Rome Statute. Essentially, the inequality is multiplied and reinforced.\nIt is impossible that these unequal relations could go on forever. But, just like the elves regarded themselves as immortal, in reality the West and its leaders cannot understand why they are not liked. French leaders find it weird that former French colonies would prefer Beijing over Paris. The legions of Western sympathisers in Central and South America, as well as Africa and parts of South East Asia, have a difficult time trying to understand why the masses would cheer Putin and Xi Jinping, but not get excited by Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.\nFor too long we have regarded a see-saw as balance. A see-saw is unbalanced or, at most, an uneasy balance, where one is higher and the other lower, only for the reverse to occur. If one remains on top, the other at the bottom need only to walk away for the one on top to be brought back down to earth. As Tolkien’s books reveal, we are made to believe that someone has to be on top or in charge for there to be stability and balance.  But that is not stability, that is dominance expressed as stability.\nOur three-legged potjie or four-legged chair is balance and stability. We need to reconstruct this world, so that it reflects not who is in charge or is the most powerful but rather how to ensure that everyone has a voice. Africa, together with Central and South America and parts of South East Asia, should not swop the dominance of the West for China, Russia and India. It is important that they join Brics, but they need to recreate the Non-Aligned Movement without India, Russia and China. They can provide Pakistan conditional membership because of its nuclear weapon capability. If Iran goes the nuclear route, they should also be treated in a similar manner.\nThe Gen-Z Non-Aligned Movement has to be different to its predecessors; it has to form a trade bloc. The non-nuclear political South has to either unite or accept that either the Western or Eastern elves remain in charge, and that we, like the dwarfs, must hide in the dark and only come out to praise them.\nDonovan E Williams is a social commentator. @TheSherpaZA on X.\nAbout\nContact\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nWhatsApp Channel\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\n\nTikTok\n\nThreads\n200 Young South Africans\nPower Of Women\nGreening The Future\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nEthics & Social Media Policy\nMail & Guardian Careers\nProperty for sale\n© 2025 The Mail & Guardian.

    "content": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\nIf you have information about cases or investigations paused or dropped by either the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchange Commission, contact Corey G. Johnson at [email protected] or 917-512-0287.\nThe Trump administration has halted litigation aimed at stopping civil rights abuses of prisoners in Louisiana and mentally ill people living in South Carolina group homes.\nThe Biden administration filed lawsuits against the two states in December after Department of Justice investigations concluded that they had failed to fix violations despite years of warnings.\nLouisiana’s prison system has kept thousands of incarcerated people behind bars for weeks, months or sometimes more than a year after they were supposed to be released, records show. And the DOJ accused South Carolina of institutionalizing thousands of people diagnosed with serious mental illnesses — sometimes for decades — rather than provide services that would allow them to live in less restricted settings, as is their right under federal law.\nFederal judges temporarily suspended the lawsuits in February at the request of the states and with the support of the DOJ.\nCivil rights lawyers who have monitored the cases said the move is another sign of the Trump administration’s retreat from the department’s mission of protecting the rights of vulnerable groups. Since January, President Donald Trump’s DOJ has dropped racial discrimination lawsuits, abandoned investigations of police misconduct and canceled oversight of troubled law enforcement agencies.\n“This administration has been very aggressive in rolling back any kind of civil rights reforms or advancements,” said Anya Bidwell, senior attorney at the public-interest law firm Institute for Justice. “It’s unquestionably disappointing.”\nThe cases against Louisiana and South Carolina were brought by a unit of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division tasked with enforcing laws that guarantee religious freedom, access to reproductive health services, constitutional policing, and the rights of people in state and local institutions, including jails, prisons and health care facilities for people with disabilities.\nThe unit, the Special Litigation Section, has seen a dramatic reduction in lawyers since Trump took office in January. Court records show at least seven attorneys working on the lawsuits against Louisiana and South Carolina are no longer with the DOJ.\nThe section had more than 90 employees at the start of the year, including about 60 front-line attorneys. By June, it had about 25, including around 15 front-line lawyers, according to a source familiar with its operation. Sources said some were reassigned to other areas of the department while others quit in protest against the direction of the office under Trump, found new jobs or took early retirement.\nSimilar departures have been seen throughout the DOJ.\nThe exodus will hamper its ability to carry out essential functions, such as battling sexual harassment in housing, discrimination against disabled people, and the improper use of restraints and seclusions against students in schools, said Omar Noureldin, a former senior attorney in the Civil Rights Division and President Joe Biden appointee who left in January.\n“Regardless of your political leanings, I think most people would agree these are the kind of bad situations that should be addressed by the nation’s top civil rights enforcer,” Noureldin said.\nA department spokesperson declined to comment in response to questions from ProPublica about the Louisiana and South Carolina cases. Sources familiar with the lawsuits said Trump appointees have told DOJ lawyers handling the cases that they want to resolve matters out of court.\nThe federal government has used settlement talks in the past to hammer out consent decrees, agreements that set a list of requirements to fix civil rights violations and are overseen by an outside monitor and federal judge to ensure compliance. But Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, Trump’s appointee to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, has made no secret of her distaste for such measures.\nIn May, Dhillon announced she was moving to dismiss efforts to impose consent decrees on the Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis police departments. She complained that consent decrees turn local control of policing over to “unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats.”\nA DOJ investigation in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer accused the department of excessive force, unjustified shootings, and discrimination against Black and Native American people. The agency issued similar findings against the Louisville Metro Police Department after the high-profile killing of Breonna Taylor, who was shot in 2020 when officers forced their way into her home to execute a search warrant.\nNoureldin, now a senior vice president at the government watchdog group Common Cause, said consent decrees provide an important level of oversight by an independent judge. By contrast, out-of-court settlements can be subject to the political whims of a new administration, which can decide to drop a case or end an agreement despite evidence of continuing constitutional violations.\n“When you have a consent decree or a court-enforced settlement, the Justice Department can’t unilaterally just withdraw from the agreement,” Noureldin said. “A federal judge would have to agree that the public interest is served by terminating that settlement.”\nIn the case of Louisiana, the Justice Department issued a scathing report in January 2023 about the state confining prisoners beyond their sentences. The problems dated back more than a decade and remained widespread, the report said. Between January and April 2022 alone, more than a quarter of everyone released from prison custody was held past their release dates. Of those, 24% spent an additional 90 days or more behind bars, the DOJ found.\nAmong those held longer than they should have been was Robert Parker, a disc jockey known as “DJ Rob” in New Orleans, where he played R&B and hip-hop music at weddings and private parties. Parker, 55, was arrested in late 2016 after violating a restraining order brought by a former girlfriend.\nHe was supposed to be released in October 2017, but a prison staffer mistakenly classified him as a sex offender. That meant he was required to provide prison authorities with two addresses where he could stay that complied with sex offender registry rules.\nPrison documents show Parker repeatedly told authorities that he wasn’t a sex offender and pleaded to speak to the warden to clear up the mistake. But nobody acted until a deputy public defender contacted state officials months later to complain. By the time he walked out, Parker had spent 337 extra days behind bars. During that period, he said, his car was repossessed, his mother died and his reputation was ruined.\n“I lost everything,” he told ProPublica in an interview from a nursing home, where he was recovering from a stroke. “I’m ready to get away from Louisiana.”\nLouisiana’s detention system is complex. Unlike other jurisdictions, where the convicted are housed in state facilities, inmates in Louisiana can be held in local jails overseen by sheriffs. A major contributor to the so-called over-detentions was poor communication among Louisiana’s court clerks, sheriff’s offices and the state department of corrections, according to interviews with attorneys, depositions of state officials, and reports from state and federal reviews of the prison system.\nUntil recently, the agencies shared prisoner sentencing information by shuttling stacks of paperwork by van or truck from the court to the sheriff’s office for the parish holding the prisoner, then to corrections officials. The document transfers, which often crisscrossed the state, typically happened only once a week. When the records finally arrived, it could take staff a month or longer to enter the data into computers, creating more delays. In addition, staff made data errors when calculating release dates.\nTwo years ago, The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Parker could pursue a lawsuit against the former head of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, James LeBlanc. That lawsuit is ongoing, said Parker’s attorney, Jonathan Rhodes. LeBlanc, who resigned last year, could not be reached for comment, and his attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill acknowledged that the state’s process to determine release dates was unreliable but said the issue had been overblown by the Justice Department’s investigation, which she called “factually incorrect.”\n“There were simply parts of it that are outside state control, such as clerks & courts,” Murrill stated.\nMurrill said correction officials have been working with local officials to ensure prisoner releases are computed in a “timely and correct fashion.” Louisiana officials point to a new website that allows electronic sharing of information among the various agencies.\n“The system has been overhauled. That has dramatically diminished, if not completely eliminated this problem,” Murrill stated. She did not address questions from ProPublica asking if prisoners were being held longer than their release dates this year.\nLocal attorneys who are handling lawsuits against the state expressed skepticism about Murrill’s claims.\nWilliam Most, an attorney who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people who had been detained past their release dates, noted that as late as May 2024, 141 people who were released that month had been kept longer than they should have been, 120 of them for more than 30 days.\n“I have seen no evidence suggesting the problem in Louisiana is fixed,” Most said. “And it seems unwise to dismiss any cases while that’s the situation.”\nSouth Carolina’s mentally ill population is grappling with similar challenges.\nAfter years of lawsuits and complaints, a DOJ investigation determined that officials illegally denied community-based services — required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and a 1999 Supreme Court decision — to over 1,000 people diagnosed as seriously mentally ill. Instead, the state placed them in group homes that failed to provide adequate care and were overly restrictive, the department alleged.\nThe DOJ report didn’t address why the state relied so heavily on group homes. It noted that South Carolina’s own goals and plans called for increasing community-based services to help more people live independently. But the investigation concluded that the availability of community-based services varied widely across the state, leaving people in some areas with no access. And the DOJ said the state’s rules for deciding when someone could leave were too stringent.\nSouth Carolina funds and oversees more than 400 facilities that serve people with serious mental illness, according to a state affidavit.\nKimberly Tissot, president of the disability rights group Able South Carolina, said it was common for disabled adults who were living successfully on their own to be involuntarily committed to an adult group home simply because they visited a hospital to pick up medicine.\nTissot, who has inspected hundreds of the adult facilities, said they often are roach-infested, soaked in urine, lacking in adequate medicine and staffed by untrained employees. Her description mirrors the findings of several state and independent investigations. In some group homes, patients weren’t allowed to leave or freely move around. Subsequently, their mental health would deteriorate, Tissot said.\n“We have had people die in these facilities because of the conditions,” said Tissot, who worked closely with the DOJ investigators. Scores of sexual abuse incidents, assaults and deaths in such group homes have been reported to the state, according to a 2022 federal report that faulted South Carolina’s oversight.\nSouth Carolina has been on notice about the difficulties since 2016 but didn’t make sufficient progress, the DOJ alleged in its lawsuit filed in December.\nAfter two years of failed attempts, state lawmakers passed a law in April that consolidated services for disabled people into a new agency responsible for expanding access to home and community-based treatments and for ensuring compliance with federal laws.\nSouth Carolina’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, has argued in the DOJ’s lawsuit that the state has been providing necessary services and has not been violating people’s constitutional rights. In January, his office asked the court for a delay in the case to give the Trump administration enough time to determine how to proceed.\nRead More\nHis office and a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities declined to comment, citing the ongoing DOJ lawsuit.\nTissot credits the federal attention with creating a sense of urgency among state lawmakers to make improvements. While she said she is pleased with the latest progress, she warned that if the DOJ dropped the case, it would undermine the enforcement of disabled people’s civil rights and allow state abuses to continue.\n“It would signal that systemic discrimination will go unchecked and embolden institutional providers to resist change,” Tissot said. “Most importantly, it abandons the people directly impacted.”\nFiled under —\nCorey G.

    "title": "Trump Administration Lowers Expectations for Trade 20250804 052328",
    "content": "Reporter\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at an Invest America Roundtable at the White House on June 9, 2025.\nReporter\nLess than 10 days till President Donald Trump’s higher “reciprocal” tariffs kick back in for most of the world, the U.S. looks like it may emerge with just a handful of trade deals.\nThe President shocked the world and roiled markets on April 2, which he dubbed “Liberation Day,” when he imposed tariffs of as high as 50% on nearly every country, before announcing a 90-day reduction in a stunning reversal just a week later. That pause, however, is ending July 9, and Trump said in a Sunday interview on Fox News, taped Friday, that he doesn’t intend to extend the deadline—although, he added, “I could, no big deal.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nOn Friday, Trump said he could do “whatever we want” with the deadline. “I’d like to make it shorter. I’d like to just send letters out to everybody, ‘Congratulations, you’re paying 25%,’” he told reporters.\nTrump’s unpredictable style has earned him the descriptor “TACO” for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” while businesses, economists, and investors have criticized him for creating a volatile business environment. The President and his officials have countered that the uncertainty is all part of a master strategy to achieve better deals.\nBut the level of trade success Trump will have achieved by next week looks to fall short of his goals. Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro touted “90 deals in 90 days” in April. As the deadline approaches though, others in the Administration are lowering expectations.\n“We’re going to do top 10 deals, put them in the right category, and then these other countries will fit behind,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Bloomberg Television last week.\nAdvertisement\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed Lutnick on Fox Business on Friday: “If we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18—there are another important 20 relationships—then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day [Sept. 1].” For other “smaller trading partners, we will just send them letters,” Bessent said on CNBC.\nJapan was one of the first countries to begin trade negotiations with the U.S. after the pause was announced, but talks have been troubled by disagreements over Japan’s policies protecting domestic rice.\n“To show people how spoiled Countries have become with respect to the United States of America, and I have great respect for Japan, they won’t take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday. (Japan imports 770,000 metric tons of rice every year without any tariffs, around half of which comes from the U.S.) “In other words, we’ll just be sending them a letter, and we love having them as a Trading Partner for many years to come.”\nAdvertisement\nThe “letters” that Trump likes to reference will notify countries of what rate their goods will be tariffed at, which Trump said on Fox News would mark “the end of the trade deal.”\nWith some trading partners, Trump’s strong-arm style has won him immediate concessions. Trump railed against Canada on Friday, announcing that he was ending trade talks over its proposed digital services tax, which he called “a direct and blatant attack on our Country.” On Sunday, Ottawa said it was abandoning the tax policy to resume negotiations with Washington in the hopes that it can reach a deal with the U.S. by July 21. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Canada “caved.”\nSimilarly, the European Union on Monday reportedly yielded to a 10% levy on many of its exports, as it pushes for lower rates on specific key sectors and exemptions to higher tariffs on automobiles as well as steel and aluminum.\nAdvertisement\nBut Trump’s hardball tactics could also sour important U.S. trade relationships, and in the long term push countries to seek alternative trading partners. The E.U., alongside its negotiations with the U.S., is preparing countermeasures to tariff U.S. goods and has stepped up discussions with China around their trade relationship in recent months.\nJayant Menon, a research fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, previously told TIME that countries will look to diversify their trade and engage with “more reliable” trading partners. And many have already begun, said Kristina Fong, an economic affairs researcher at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, especially in terms of increasing trade with China. “It’s a very slow burn kind of momentum, but that’s always been, I think, the underlying case,” Fong told TIME.\nMoreover, “smaller trading partners” that haven’t even gotten a seat at the negotiating table are likely to be hit hardest. Trump’s apparent dismissal of these countries, similar to his decision to shutter USAID, suggests that he doesn’t see the benefits of having positive relations with them.\nAdvertisement\nMany of them were already hit with some of the highest “reciprocal” tariffs when they were initially announced, and many aren’t in a position to simply purchase more American goods. Lesotho, which was hit with the highest 50% rate, was pessimistic at the outset of the pause, with the country’s trade and industry minister saying, “I don’t have a good experience with trying to get meetings with [the Trump Administration].”\n“We’ll look at how a country treats us—are they good, are they not so good? Some countries we don’t care, we’ll just send a high number out,” Trump said on Fox News. “Congratulations, we’re allowing you to shop in the United States of America. You’re going to pay a 25% tariff or 35% or 50% or 10%.”\n“What does this do long term to trust and confidence [in the U.S.]?” says Mark Cogan, associate professor of peace and conflict studies at Japan’s Kansai Gaidai University, tells TIME. “You’re bullying your way to get what you want, and that reduces trust.

    "title": "Trump Administration Moves Quietly to Eliminate Li 20250804 060604",
    "content": "Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins is moving to stop vets and their dependents from accessing abortion counseling and services.Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/ZUMA\nOn Friday, the Department of Veterans Affairs proposed a policy change that advocates for reproductive rights say could become one of the strictest abortion bans nationwide.\nThe department filed a proposed rule seeking to eliminate coverage for the limited abortion services and counseling that have been available to veterans and their beneficiaries under the VA health care system for nearly three years.\nIn September 2022, a few months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the VA under the Biden administration began covering abortion counseling, as well as abortion services for veterans and beneficiaries who report experiencing rape or incest or whose health is endangered by carrying a pregnancy to term. Former VA Secretary Denis McDonough called the move “a patient safety decision,” and advocates praised the policy change for providing a lifeline for the most vulnerable veterans and their beneficiaries in the 15 states that had total or near-total bans at the time. (That tally is now 16 states.)\nBut the Trump administration alleges that the rule change was a matter of federal overreach, alleging it “contradicted decades of Federal policy against forced taxpayer funding for abortion.” And in arguing its position for yanking extremely limited abortion services from veterans and their dependents, the Trump administration has put forth misinformation and contradictions.\nThe proposed measure, says Sen. Patty Murray, is “unspeakably cruel and a grotesque assault on women who have put their lives on the line to keep us safe.”\nThe proposed rule states, for example, that the government would indeed allow abortions to proceed in life-threatening situations such as ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages. Yet, confusingly, the text also blasts “claims in the prior administration’s rule that abortions throughout pregnancy are needed to save the lives of pregnant women” as “incorrect.”\nIn fact, ectopic pregnancies are nonviable and life-threatening for the pregnant person, and incomplete miscarriages—in which abortion procedures are typically used to empty the uterus—can lead to hemorrhages, sepsis, and death. And contrary to the Trump administration’s claim that “no State law prohibits treatment for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages to save the life of a mother,” reporting from ProPublica has shown that strict abortion bans have created a chilling effect for doctors, who have feared running afoul of abortion bans and have delayed intervening in medical emergencies, resulting in higher rates of sepsis and death.\nThe Trump administration further argues that minimal use of the existing policy by veterans makes it unnecessary in the first place. To abortion rights advocates, that claim is nonsensical and will cause harm. “After veterans put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms, the Trump administration is trying to rob them of their own freedoms and putting their health at risk,” Nancy Northup, President and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. “This administration is sending a clear message to veterans—that their health and dignity aren’t worth defending.”\nWomen are the fastest-growing group of veterans, with more than two million living in the US, according to VA data. As of 2024, more than half of women veterans of reproductive age lived in states that banned abortion or were likely to, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.\nThe Center of Reproductive Rights also notes that one in three women veterans report experiencing sexual assault or harassment during their military service, according to VA data, which can lead to a need for abortion services. Unplanned pregnancies—particularly as a result of sexual assault—can also exacerbate the post-traumatic stress disorder that many veterans experience.\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), a vocal advocate for abortion rights and a senior member of the Senate Veteran Affairs’ Committee, called the measure “unspeakably cruel and a grotesque assault on women who have put their lives on the line to keep us safe.”\n“Donald Trump insisted time and again on the campaign trail that he supported exceptions for rape and incest—now he’s going after exactly those exceptions with this move to axe the incredibly limited abortion services VA provides for women veterans in desperate situations,” Murray said in a statement.\nThis policy move may come as no surprise, given that Project 2025 recommended it and Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins has been vocal about his anti-abortion views, as I wrote back in January.\nThe administration’s filing on Friday in the Federal Register marks the first step in the process of changing the agency’s rules; the next step consists of a 30-day public comment period, beginning on Monday. After that, the agency can finalize the rule, and it would take effect 30 days after being published.\nIf the proposal is finalized, which appears likely, it will be just the latest example of efforts to restrict abortion, even in states where the procedure is legal.\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n“Lying.” “Disgusting.” “Scum.” “Slime.” “Corrupt.” “Enemy of the people.” Donald Trump has always made clear what he thinks of journalists.

    "title": "Trump Administration Moves Quietly to Eliminate Li 20250804 061703",
    "content": "Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins is moving to stop vets and their dependents from accessing abortion counseling and services.Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/ZUMA\nOn Friday, the Department of Veterans Affairs proposed a policy change that advocates for reproductive rights say could become one of the strictest abortion bans nationwide.\nThe department filed a proposed rule seeking to eliminate coverage for the limited abortion services and counseling that have been available to veterans and their beneficiaries under the VA health care system for nearly three years.\nIn September 2022, a few months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the VA under the Biden administration began covering abortion counseling, as well as abortion services for veterans and beneficiaries who report experiencing rape or incest or whose health is endangered by carrying a pregnancy to term. Former VA Secretary Denis McDonough called the move “a patient safety decision,” and advocates praised the policy change for providing a lifeline for the most vulnerable veterans and their beneficiaries in the 15 states that had total or near-total bans at the time. (That tally is now 16 states.)\nBut the Trump administration alleges that the rule change was a matter of federal overreach, alleging it “contradicted decades of Federal policy against forced taxpayer funding for abortion.” And in arguing its position for yanking extremely limited abortion services from veterans and their dependents, the Trump administration has put forth misinformation and contradictions.\nThe proposed measure, says Sen. Patty Murray, is “unspeakably cruel and a grotesque assault on women who have put their lives on the line to keep us safe.”\nThe proposed rule states, for example, that the government would indeed allow abortions to proceed in life-threatening situations such as ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages. Yet, confusingly, the text also blasts “claims in the prior administration’s rule that abortions throughout pregnancy are needed to save the lives of pregnant women” as “incorrect.”\nIn fact, ectopic pregnancies are nonviable and life-threatening for the pregnant person, and incomplete miscarriages—in which abortion procedures are typically used to empty the uterus—can lead to hemorrhages, sepsis, and death. And contrary to the Trump administration’s claim that “no State law prohibits treatment for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages to save the life of a mother,” reporting from ProPublica has shown that strict abortion bans have created a chilling effect for doctors, who have feared running afoul of abortion bans and have delayed intervening in medical emergencies, resulting in higher rates of sepsis and death.\nThe Trump administration further argues that minimal use of the existing policy by veterans makes it unnecessary in the first place.

    "content": "Witkoff will discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine as Trump says again that he wants a ‘deal where people stop getting killed’.\nUnited States President Donald Trump said his special envoy Steve Witkoff will visit Russia next week to continue talks on the war in Ukraine.\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said Witkoff would visit, “I think next week, Wednesday or Thursday.”\nResponding to questions from reporters on what Russia could do to avoid looming sanctions, the US president replied: “Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed.”\nTrump has threatened to impose “very severe tariffs” on Russia if it fails to reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine soon.\nTrump also said that two nuclear submarines he deployed following an online row with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were now “in the region.”\nTrump has not said whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the exact deployment locations, which are kept secret by the US military.\nTrump’s latest comments come after he recently described Russia’s actions in its war on Ukraine as “disgusting“, after a Russian attack on an apartment block in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, killed 31 people on Thursday.\nThe attack capped off a month of a record 6,297 Russian long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, a 14-fold increase from July 2024.\nUkraine is looking forward to receiving a US-made Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which Trump has promised will be delivered, albeit with funding from Ukraine’s European allies, not the Trump administration.\nUkraine has also continued to launch its own attacks on Russia, with its most recent attacks on Sunday killing three people across the country and causing a major fire at an oil refinery.\nA Ukrainian drone attack on Monday morning sparked a fire at a railway station in Russia’s Volgograd region, the regional administration said on Telegram.\nAs fighting has continued, Russian and Ukrainian officials have held several meetings in recent months in Istanbul, Turkiye.\nThe latest meeting secured an agreement to exchange 1,200 prisoners, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Sunday.\nRussia has yet to comment.\nWitkoff, a real estate magnate and Trump golf partner, has already met with Russian President Vladimir Putin multiple times in Moscow in his role as a White House special envoy.\nAs a special envoy to the Middle East, he is also Trump’s representative in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, which saw him visit Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday, where he met with the families of captives held in Gaza.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "content": "Witkoff will discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine as Trump says again that he wants a ‘deal where people stop getting killed’.\nUnited States President Donald Trump said his special envoy Steve Witkoff will visit Russia next week to continue talks on the war in Ukraine.\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said Witkoff would visit, “I think next week, Wednesday or Thursday.”\nResponding to questions from reporters on what Russia could do to avoid looming sanctions, the US president replied: “Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed.”\nTrump has threatened to impose “very severe tariffs” on Russia if it fails to reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine soon.\nTrump also said that two nuclear submarines he deployed following an online row with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were now “in the region.”\nTrump has not said whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the exact deployment locations, which are kept secret by the US military.\nTrump’s latest comments come after he recently described Russia’s actions in its war on Ukraine as “disgusting“, after a Russian attack on an apartment block in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, killed 31 people on Thursday.\nThe attack capped off a month of a record 6,297 Russian long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, a 14-fold increase from July 2024.\nUkraine is looking forward to receiving a US-made Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which Trump has promised will be delivered, albeit with funding from Ukraine’s European allies, not the Trump administration.\nUkraine has also continued to launch its own attacks on Russia, with its most recent attacks on Sunday killing three people across the country and causing a major fire at an oil refinery.\nA Ukrainian drone attack on Monday morning sparked a fire at a railway station in Russia’s Volgograd region, the regional administration said on Telegram.\nAs fighting has continued, Russian and Ukrainian officials have held several meetings in recent months in Istanbul, Turkiye.\nThe latest meeting secured an agreement to exchange 1,200 prisoners, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Sunday.\nRussia has yet to comment.\nWitkoff, a real estate magnate and Trump golf partner, has already met with Russian President Vladimir Putin multiple times in Moscow in his role as a White House special envoy.\nAs a special envoy to the Middle East, he is also Trump’s representative in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, which saw him visit Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday, where he met with the families of captives held in Gaza.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "content": "\n\n      Erika Beras\n    \n\nThe iconic American company, U.S. Steel was sold to Nippon Steel in Japan earlier this summer. The terms of the deal give President Trump an outsized say in the future of U.S. Steel.\nSARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  This summer, Japan's Nippon Steel bought U.S. Steel. Now, the U.S. government and President Trump have a say in its operations. Planet Money's Erika Beras explains what Trump calls a golden share.ERIKA BERAS, BYLINE: When a foreign company wants to buy or invest big money in an American company, they can't just go ahead and do it. Deals that might touch on national security, they're reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. It's America's gatekeeper making sure any foreign investor coming in is going to be on our side, and the vast majority of what CFIUS does is behind the scenes.Did you have to, like, take an oath?SARAH BAUERLE DANZMAN: I got a top-secret security clearance.BERAS: Sarah Bauerle Danzman is a political economist at Indiana University. She did a stint as a CFIUS case officer, so she's had a firsthand look at the national security agreements that CFIUS negotiates. Historically, they've been related to defense. But under both the Trump and Biden administrations, the committee has been reviewing a broader category of business transactions - cybersecurity, AI, biotechnology, clean energy and now this U.S. Steel deal. On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name. Nippon must invest billions of dollars updating mills. No factory can close, no salaries reduced without President Trump's approval. And the agreement actually includes his name.DANZMAN: That's not normal. In any other situation, the whole thing about, like, getting Donald J. Trump's express consent would not be there.BERAS: President Trump used an unusual term to describe this unusual arrangement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a golden stock. We have a golden share, which I control or a president controls. Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s. The U.K. privatized state-owned industries and used golden shares as a way to ease into a freer market. Since then, others have also used golden shares - China, Russia, Brazil. But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share. And when we asked the White House why they call it a golden share, they said \"The Golden National Security Agreement Outlining Certain Provisions And Stipulations Governing Nippon Steel's Acquisition Of U.S. Steel\" didn't really have the same ring to it, nor did, quote, \"metallic gray share.\" Either way, it's the U.S. government getting a big say in the C-suite.

On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name. Nippon must invest billions of dollars updating mills. No factory can close, no salaries reduced without President Trump's approval.

We have a golden share, which I control or a president controls. Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s. The U.K. privatized state-owned industries and used golden shares as a way to ease into a freer market. Since then, others have also used golden shares - China, Russia, Brazil. But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share. And when we asked the White House why they call it a golden share, they said \"The Golden National Security Agreement Outlining Certain Provisions And Stipulations Governing Nippon Steel's Acquisition Of U.S. Steel\" didn't really have the same ring to it, nor did, quote, \"metallic gray share.\" Either way, it's the U.S. government getting a big say in the C-suite.

Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s. The U.K. privatized state-owned industries and used golden shares as a way to ease into a freer market. Since then, others have also used golden shares - China, Russia, Brazil. But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share. And when we asked the White House why they call it a golden share, they said \"The Golden National Security Agreement Outlining Certain Provisions And Stipulations Governing Nippon Steel's Acquisition Of U.S. Steel\" didn't really have the same ring to it, nor did, quote, \"metallic gray share.\" Either way, it's the U.S. government getting a big say in the C-suite.

But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share.

    "content": "Erika Beras\nThe iconic American company, U.S. Steel was sold to Nippon Steel in Japan earlier this summer. The terms of the deal give President Trump an outsized say in the future of U.S. Steel.\nSARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  This summer, Japan's Nippon Steel bought U.S. Steel. Now, the U.S. government and President Trump have a say in its operations. Planet Money's Erika Beras explains what Trump calls a golden share.ERIKA BERAS, BYLINE: When a foreign company wants to buy or invest big money in an American company, they can't just go ahead and do it. Deals that might touch on national security, they're reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. It's America's gatekeeper making sure any foreign investor coming in is going to be on our side, and the vast majority of what CFIUS does is behind the scenes.Did you have to, like, take an oath?SARAH BAUERLE DANZMAN: I got a top-secret security clearance.BERAS: Sarah Bauerle Danzman is a political economist at Indiana University. She did a stint as a CFIUS case officer, so she's had a firsthand look at the national security agreements that CFIUS negotiates. Historically, they've been related to defense. But under both the Trump and Biden administrations, the committee has been reviewing a broader category of business transactions - cybersecurity, AI, biotechnology, clean energy and now this U.S. Steel deal. On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name. Nippon must invest billions of dollars updating mills. No factory can close, no salaries reduced without President Trump's approval. And the agreement actually includes his name.DANZMAN: That's not normal. In any other situation, the whole thing about, like, getting Donald J. Trump's express consent would not be there.BERAS: President Trump used an unusual term to describe this unusual arrangement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a golden stock. We have a golden share, which I control or a president controls. Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s.

Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s. The U.K. privatized state-owned industries and used golden shares as a way to ease into a freer market. Since then, others have also used golden shares - China, Russia, Brazil. But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share. And when we asked the White House why they call it a golden share, they said \"The Golden National Security Agreement Outlining Certain Provisions And Stipulations Governing Nippon Steel's Acquisition Of U.S. Steel\" didn't really have the same ring to it, nor did, quote, \"metallic gray share.\" Either way, it's the U.S. government getting a big say in the C-suite.

    "content": "Erika Beras\nThe iconic American company, U.S. Steel was sold to Nippon Steel in Japan earlier this summer. The terms of the deal give President Trump an outsized say in the future of U.S. Steel.\nSARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  This summer, Japan's Nippon Steel bought U.S. Steel. Now, the U.S. government and President Trump have a say in its operations. Planet Money's Erika Beras explains what Trump calls a golden share.ERIKA BERAS, BYLINE: When a foreign company wants to buy or invest big money in an American company, they can't just go ahead and do it. Deals that might touch on national security, they're reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. It's America's gatekeeper making sure any foreign investor coming in is going to be on our side, and the vast majority of what CFIUS does is behind the scenes.Did you have to, like, take an oath?SARAH BAUERLE DANZMAN: I got a top-secret security clearance.BERAS: Sarah Bauerle Danzman is a political economist at Indiana University. She did a stint as a CFIUS case officer, so she's had a firsthand look at the national security agreements that CFIUS negotiates. Historically, they've been related to defense. But under both the Trump and Biden administrations, the committee has been reviewing a broader category of business transactions - cybersecurity, AI, biotechnology, clean energy and now this U.S. Steel deal. On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name. Nippon must invest billions of dollars updating mills. No factory can close, no salaries reduced without President Trump's approval. And the agreement actually includes his name.DANZMAN: That's not normal. In any other situation, the whole thing about, like, getting Donald J. Trump's express consent would not be there.BERAS: President Trump used an unusual term to describe this unusual arrangement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a golden stock. We have a golden share, which I control or a president controls. Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s. The U.K. privatized state-owned industries and used golden shares as a way to ease into a freer market. Since then, others have also used golden shares - China, Russia, Brazil. But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share.

Planet Money's Erika Beras explains what Trump calls a golden share.ERIKA BERAS, BYLINE: When a foreign company wants to buy or invest big money in an American company, they can't just go ahead and do it. Deals that might touch on national security, they're reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. It's America's gatekeeper making sure any foreign investor coming in is going to be on our side, and the vast majority of what CFIUS does is behind the scenes.Did you have to, like, take an oath?SARAH BAUERLE DANZMAN: I got a top-secret security clearance.BERAS: Sarah Bauerle Danzman is a political economist at Indiana University. She did a stint as a CFIUS case officer, so she's had a firsthand look at the national security agreements that CFIUS negotiates. Historically, they've been related to defense. But under both the Trump and Biden administrations, the committee has been reviewing a broader category of business transactions - cybersecurity, AI, biotechnology, clean energy and now this U.S. Steel deal. On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name. Nippon must invest billions of dollars updating mills. No factory can close, no salaries reduced without President Trump's approval. And the agreement actually includes his name.DANZMAN: That's not normal. In any other situation, the whole thing about, like, getting Donald J. Trump's express consent would not be there.BERAS: President Trump used an unusual term to describe this unusual arrangement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a golden stock. We have a golden share, which I control or a president controls. Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s.

She did a stint as a CFIUS case officer, so she's had a firsthand look at the national security agreements that CFIUS negotiates. Historically, they've been related to defense. But under both the Trump and Biden administrations, the committee has been reviewing a broader category of business transactions - cybersecurity, AI, biotechnology, clean energy and now this U.S. Steel deal. On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name. Nippon must invest billions of dollars updating mills. No factory can close, no salaries reduced without President Trump's approval. And the agreement actually includes his name.DANZMAN: That's not normal. In any other situation, the whole thing about, like, getting Donald J. Trump's express consent would not be there.BERAS: President Trump used an unusual term to describe this unusual arrangement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a golden stock. We have a golden share, which I control or a president controls. Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s. The U.K. privatized state-owned industries and used golden shares as a way to ease into a freer market. Since then, others have also used golden shares - China, Russia, Brazil. But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share.

The terms of the deal give President Trump an outsized say in the future of U.S. Steel.\nSARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  This summer, Japan's Nippon Steel bought U.S. Steel. Now, the U.S. government and President Trump have a say in its operations. Planet Money's Erika Beras explains what Trump calls a golden share.ERIKA BERAS, BYLINE: When a foreign company wants to buy or invest big money in an American company, they can't just go ahead and do it. Deals that might touch on national security, they're reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. It's America's gatekeeper making sure any foreign investor coming in is going to be on our side, and the vast majority of what CFIUS does is behind the scenes.Did you have to, like, take an oath?SARAH BAUERLE DANZMAN: I got a top-secret security clearance.BERAS: Sarah Bauerle Danzman is a political economist at Indiana University. She did a stint as a CFIUS case officer, so she's had a firsthand look at the national security agreements that CFIUS negotiates. Historically, they've been related to defense. But under both the Trump and Biden administrations, the committee has been reviewing a broader category of business transactions - cybersecurity, AI, biotechnology, clean energy and now this U.S. Steel deal. On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name. Nippon must invest billions of dollars updating mills. No factory can close, no salaries reduced without President Trump's approval. And the agreement actually includes his name.DANZMAN: That's not normal. In any other situation, the whole thing about, like, getting Donald J. Trump's express consent would not be there.BERAS: President Trump used an unusual term to describe this unusual arrangement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a golden stock. We have a golden share, which I control or a president controls. Now...BERAS: Is a golden share a new thing?DANZMAN: No. It's a new thing for the U.S.BERAS: Imagine a company has, like, a hundred shares. Usually, the more shares you have, the more power you have, but some shares have extra powers.DANZMAN: A golden share is a different class of shares in which a government can own a very small percentage of the company but has outsized voting rights.BERAS: So they are, like, a super special shareholder.DANZMAN: Yes.BERAS: The idea comes from the U.K. in the 1980s. The U.K. privatized state-owned industries and used golden shares as a way to ease into a freer market. Since then, others have also used golden shares - China, Russia, Brazil. But what Trump is doing with U.S. Steel, it's an unusual take.DANZMAN: It doesn't appear to be a golden share...BERAS: At least not a typical one.DANZMAN: ...Because the U.S. government does not appear to actually hold an equity stake in U.S. Steel.BERAS: What does that mean?DANZMAN: It means that what the U.S. government has is kind of extra special governance rights.BERAS: Sarah says it's a symbolic golden share. And when we asked the White House why they call it a golden share, they said \"The Golden National Security Agreement Outlining Certain Provisions And Stipulations Governing Nippon Steel's Acquisition Of U.S. Steel\" didn't really have the same ring to it, nor did, quote, \"metallic gray share.\" Either way, it's the U.S. government getting a big say in the C-suite.

On the day it was signed, a White House spokesperson said it will safeguard U.S. national and economic security. The deal stipulates all kinds of things. Nippon cannot change U.S. Steel's name.

    "title": "Under RFK Jr  CDC skips study on vaccination rates 20250804 052317",
    "content": "Vaccination rates fell once again as nonmedical exemptions hit a new high.\nVaccination rates among the country's kindergartners have fallen once again, with coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination dropping from 92.7 percent in the 2023–2024 school year to 92.5 percent in 2024–2025. The percentage changes are small across the board, but they represent thousands of children and an ongoing downward trend that makes the country more vulnerable to outbreaks.\nIn the latest school year, an estimated 286,000 young children were not fully protected against measles. At the same time, the country has seen numerous explosive measles outbreaks, with case counts in 2025 already higher than any other year since the highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in 2000. In fact, the case count is at a 33-year high.\nThe latest small decline is one in a series that is eroding the nation's ability to keep bygone infectious diseases at bay. In the 2019–2020 school year, 95 percent of kindergartners were protected against measles and other serious childhood diseases, such as polio. That 95 percent coverage is the target that health experts say prevents an infectious disease from spreading in a community. But amid the pandemic, vaccination rates fell, dropping to 93.9 percent MMR coverage in the 2020–2021 year, and have kept creeping downward.\nAt the height of the pandemic, some slippage in immunization coverage could be blamed on disrupted access. But anti-vaccine sentiments and misinformation are clearly playing a large role as vaccination continues to decline and access has largely resumed. For the 2024–2025 school year, nonmedical exemptions for childhood vaccinations once again hit a new high. These are exemptions driven by ideology and have risen with the influence of anti-vaccine voices, including current health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nNon-medical exemptions rose from 2.2 percent before the pandemic (2019–2020) to 3.1 percent in 2023–2024 and now to the all-time high of 3.4 percent in the 2024–2025 school year. Medical exemptions, meanwhile, have held steady in recent years at 0.2 percent.\nAs the top health official in the country, Kennedy has wasted no time in his short tenure to undermine federal infrastructure, public trust, and national access to vaccines.\nEven the way the new vaccination data was released reflects Kennedy's agenda of subverting life-saving vaccines. Normally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produces a detailed analysis of vaccination coverage data and publishes it in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). But the publication has been throttled since Kennedy took the helm, and people close to the publication have said that it can't publish studies unless Kennedy personally signs off on them, though the US health department denied this.\nThis year, there was no detailed report of the vaccination data or any announcement of its publication. A brief summary in bullet points and some limited data were merely posted online late Thursday.\nWhen the Associated Press contacted the health department for comment on the data, the agency responded with an ambivalent statement: \"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.\"\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years. With our unique combination of\n          technical savvy and wide-ranging interest in the technological arts\n          and sciences, Ars is the trusted source in a sea of information.

    "content": "“The children I met are not victims of a natural disaster,” said the UNICEF deputy director, “They are being starved.”\nTruthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.\nThe deputy director of UNICEF returned from his most recent trip to the Gaza Strip this week and has issued a fresh warning to the world that immediate and forceful action must be taken to end the suffering that is being imposed by Israel on the children who live in the war-torn enclave that now teeters on the edge of full-blown famine as bombs continue to be dropped, nowhere is safe, and kids are dying at a rate of more than two dozen every single day.\nUNICEF deputy director Ted Chaiban said in a Friday statement that he had just completed his fourth in-person visit to Gaza since the war that began “after the horrors of October 7th,” but that there was no preparing for what he witnessed in recent days.\n“You see the images on the news, and you know what has happened, but it is still shocking when you are there,” he said. “The marks of deep suffering and hunger were visible on the faces of families and children. Over 18,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war. That’s an average of 28 children a day, the size of a classroom, gone. Children have lost loved ones, they are hungry and scared, and they are traumatized.”\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nCalling the conditions that Israel has created on the ground in Gaza “inhumane,” Mr. Chaiban demanded a sustained ceasefire and a political way forward. He also detailed how the United Nations has now identified two indicators showing that Gaza has “exceeded the famine threshold,” and that the occupied territory “faces grave risk of famine” due to the ongoing Israeli blockade that prevents humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians, even as the number of documented deaths from acute starvation continue to mount and the killings of people trying to reach aid distribution points continues to climb.\n“This simply should not be happening. The children I met are not victims of a natural disaster,” Chaiban said Friday of the young Palestinians, critically malnourished, he met during his visit to Gaza in the preceding days. “They are being starved, bombed, and displaced.”\nAid organizations as well as Palestinians living in Gaza are describing horrific scenes as the famine conditions grip the population and the suffering of children escalates from a situation that has been described as “hell on earth” for well over a year.\n“All my children have lost nearly half of their body weight,” Jamil Mughari, a 38-year-old from Maghazi in central Gaza, told the Guardian in an interview published Saturday. “My daughter, who is five years old, now weighs only 11kg. My son Mohammad has become just skin and bones. All my children are like this.”\n“I myself used to weigh 85kg,” Mughari explained, “and now I’m down to 55.”\nRejecting the misguided suggestion that airdrops should be part of the solution to the starvation crisis in Gaza, Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said Friday that a large number of trucks, alongside the return of experts in the distribution of humanitarian aid, is the best solution.“As the people of Gaza are starving to death, the only way to respond to the famine is to flood Gaza with assistance,” said Lazzarini. “UNRWA, the largest UN agency on the ground, has 6,000 trucks loaded with aid stuck outside Gaza waiting for the green light to enter.”\nWhile UNICEF is helping some limited aid reach people in need, Chaiban said the trickle allowed by Israel is nowhere close to what’s needed to save lives and that efforts to change the policies have been rebuffed, even as “children are dying at an unprecedented rate” with no end in sight.\n“We are at a crossroads,” he said, after calling for the entry of at least 500 trucks per day to deliver life-saving supplies. “The choices made now will determine whether tens of thousands of children live or die. We know what must be done and what can be done.”\nAmidst the carnage and growing global outrage over Israel’s genoce in Gaza, critics of the U.S. backing of the underlying policies continue to acknowledge and decry the shameful complicity of the Trump administration, members of Congress, and influential media outlets who offer material support and political cover to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“The debate over whether or not Gaza is a genocide is, effectively, over. So can we now also stop pretending that we are mere bystanders to this genocide? That our sin is one only of omission rather than commission?” asked Zeteo founder Mehdi Hasan in a Guardian op-ed on Saturday.\n“The inconvenient truth is that the U.S. has not just looked the other way, as tens of thousands of Palestinians have been besieged and bombed, starved and slaughtered, but helped Israel pull the trigger,” argued Hasan. “We have been complicit in this genocide, which is itself a crime under article III of the Genocide convention.”\nOn Friday, as Common Dreams reported, Human Rights Watch issued a new report on the starvation in Gaza and said it was “indefensible” for the U.S. government to continue its backing of Israel.\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who led another failed effort this week in the U.S. Senate to block further military support of Israel, struck a similiar tone in the Boston Globe on Friday when he wrote that most Americans, according to recent polling, oppose what’s taking place in Gaza.\n“At a time when Israeli soldiers are routinely shooting civilians trying to get food, when Gaza faces mass starvation, and when extremist settlers terrorize Palestinians in the West Bank, the United States should not provide more weapons to enable these atrocities,” Sanders wrote.\n“Americans want this to end. They do not want to be complicit in an unfolding famine and daily massacres. Congress has the power to act — to use our leverage of billions in military aid to demand Israel end this slaughter,” he added. “History will condemn those who fail to do so.”\nSparing neither the current nor former U.S. administrations in his remarks, Hasan said that the history books will remember where people stood and when.\n“To the Biden and Trump administrations, to Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to the US media, I say this: history will judge you,” Hasan wrote. “For the bombs you sent, the votes you cast, the lies you told. This will be your shameful legacy when the dust finally settles in Gaza, when all of the bodies have been pulled from the rubble. Not defending your ally or fighting terrorism, but non-stop complicity in a genocide; aiding and abetting the crime of crimes.”\nWith Trump’s fascist agenda driving the narrative, it’s the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.\nYet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining. Why? Blatant political censorship from Big Tech.\nAs we face mounting repression, Truthout appeals for your support.

The children I met are not victims of a natural disaster,” Chaiban said Friday of the young Palestinians, critically malnourished, he met during his visit to Gaza in the preceding days. “They are being starved, bombed, and displaced.”\nAid organizations as well as Palestinians living in Gaza are describing horrific scenes as the famine conditions grip the population and the suffering of children escalates from a situation that has been described as “hell on earth” for well over a year.\n“All my children have lost nearly half of their body weight,” Jamil Mughari, a 38-year-old from Maghazi in central Gaza, told the Guardian in an interview published Saturday. “My daughter, who is five years old, now weighs only 11kg. My son Mohammad has become just skin and bones. All my children are like this.”\n“I myself used to weigh 85kg,” Mughari explained, “and now I’m down to 55.”\nRejecting the misguided suggestion that airdrops should be part of the solution to the starvation crisis in Gaza, Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said Friday that a large number of trucks, alongside the return of experts in the distribution of humanitarian aid, is the best solution.“As the people of Gaza are starving to death, the only way to respond to the famine is to flood Gaza with assistance,” said Lazzarini. “UNRWA, the largest UN agency on the ground, has 6,000 trucks loaded with aid stuck outside Gaza waiting for the green light to enter.”\nWhile UNICEF is helping some limited aid reach people in need, Chaiban said the trickle allowed by Israel is nowhere close to what’s needed to save lives and that efforts to change the policies have been rebuffed, even as “children are dying at an unprecedented rate” with no end in sight.\n“We are at a crossroads,” he said, after calling for the entry of at least 500 trucks per day to deliver life-saving supplies. “The choices made now will determine whether tens of thousands of children live or die. We know what must be done and what can be done.”\nAmidst the carnage and growing global outrage over Israel’s genoce in Gaza, critics of the U.S. backing of the underlying policies continue to acknowledge and decry the shameful complicity of the Trump administration, members of Congress, and influential media outlets who offer material support and political cover to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“The debate over whether or not Gaza is a genocide is, effectively, over. So can we now also stop pretending that we are mere bystanders to this genocide? That our sin is one only of omission rather than commission?” asked Zeteo founder Mehdi Hasan in a Guardian op-ed on Saturday.\n“The inconvenient truth is that the U.S. has not just looked the other way, as tens of thousands of Palestinians have been besieged and bombed, starved and slaughtered, but helped Israel pull the trigger,” argued Hasan. “We have been complicit in this genocide, which is itself a crime under article III of the Genocide convention.”\nOn Friday, as Common Dreams reported, Human Rights Watch issued a new report on the starvation in Gaza and said it was “indefensible” for the U.S. government to continue its backing of Israel.\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who led another failed effort this week in the U.S. Senate to block further military support of Israel, struck a similiar tone in the Boston Globe on Friday when he wrote that most Americans, according to recent polling, oppose what’s taking place in Gaza.\n“At a time when Israeli soldiers are routinely shooting civilians trying to get food, when Gaza faces mass starvation, and when extremist settlers terrorize Palestinians in the West Bank, the United States should not provide more weapons to enable these atrocities,” Sanders wrote.\n“Americans want this to end. They do not want to be complicit in an unfolding famine and daily massacres. Congress has the power to act — to use our leverage of billions in military aid to demand Israel end this slaughter,” he added. “History will condemn those who fail to do so.”\nSparing neither the current nor former U.S. administrations in his remarks, Hasan said that the history books will remember where people stood and when.\n“To the Biden and Trump administrations, to Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to the US media, I say this: history will judge you,” Hasan wrote. “For the bombs you sent, the votes you cast, the lies you told. This will be your shameful legacy when the dust finally settles in Gaza, when all of the bodies have been pulled from the rubble. Not defending your ally or fighting terrorism, but non-stop complicity in a genocide; aiding and abetting the crime of crimes.”\nWith Trump’s fascist agenda driving the narrative, it’s the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.\nYet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining. Why? Blatant political censorship from Big Tech.\nAs we face mounting repression, Truthout appeals for your support.

    "content": "Institutions of higher education are working with federal immigration agencies to form a new academic police state.\nSupport justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!\nIn 1998, Tania Cepero Lopez surrendered herself at Miami International Airport as a Cuban refugee. She was a 19-year-old with a dream to become an educator. In the U.S. she believed she could freely teach ideas — even if they triggered debate or discomfort — without fear of repression from the government.\nFor some time, Cepero Lopez lived out that dream as a professor at Florida International University (FIU). Then Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” in 2022, limiting instruction on topics involving race and gender.\nSuddenly, Cepero Lopez watched as her university contorted to fit DeSantis’ agenda. Flags of countries disappeared from the student center. Colleagues stopped assigning certain readings, for fear they’d be “flagged under the new anti-woke laws,” she said. To defend academic freedom and “push back against intrusion from the state,” in 2024 Cepero Lopez became president of the United Faculty of Florida union at FIU.\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nBut a year later, the state is once again interfering — this time beyond the walls of Cepero Lopez’s classroom. As the fall semester looms and students and faculty prepare to return to campus, their educational futures teeter on the edge of DeSantis’ new demand: for Florida police to assist with immigration enforcement.\nIf President Donald Trump successfully fulfills his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people per year, it would make the largest expulsion operation in U.S. history. The Obama administration currently holds the record for deporting 3 million people.\nTo surpass the Democrats, the Trump administration has authorized a full-fledged constitutional assault on immigrants — detaining and deporting immigrants of all kinds without due process. Trump has also leveraged data from the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better target immigrants.\nAgencies DHS directly oversees — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses Border Patrol — are going to new extremes to meet Trump’s quota of detaining 3,000 people per day.\nAgents wait at schools, courthouses, hospitals, and churches, searching for immigrants to detain. They point guns at passersby who take photos of their license plates and tackle people into the ground as they attempt to flee. They conduct surprise checkpoints miles from U.S. borders, confiscate phones, and question people about their political beliefs when they arrive in the U.S.\nImmigrant rights activists warn that ICE’s unchecked actions normalize the pervasive presence of immigration enforcement in American life. Civil rights experts say insatiable levels of surveillance by CBP and other federal agencies, alongside racial profiling of Muslim, Native American, and Latinx citizens are deconstructing democracy. Soon, immigration enforcement may escalate even further.\nOn July 4, Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, granting ICE and CBP hundreds of billions of dollars to spend through September 2029 — the largest single investment in federal immigration agencies since DHS was created in 2003.\n“These systems are now representing a threat to people of color, a threat to immigrants, [and] a threat to humanity,” said Afaf Nasher, licensed attorney and executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “This is an emboldening of the profound racist roots of this country, and they have the weight and the authority of DHS behind them.”\nBut another set of tools in the government’s mass deportation arsenal are universities. Since the start of Trump’s second term, colleges in both blue and red states have signed contracts with ICE and CBP — agreeing to donate their resources to question and detain immigrants, train federal employees, and provide spaces for intelligence research.\nFaculty, students, legal experts, and immigration advocates have spoken out about the increased potential for campus immigration raids and shared the threats they say these partnerships pose: to civil liberties and academic freedom, students being sent to the ICE camp in the Everglades, and more.\nUniversities are moving forward with the contracts anyway.\nHigher education is in disarray as the Trump administration attacks the premise of academic freedom by stripping universities of funds, revoking international students’ visas, and tearing apart diversity, equity and inclusion programs, claiming they are discriminatory.\nFor Floridians like Cepero Lopez, Trump’s authoritarian playbook has been years in the making. DeSantis has exerted unchecked influence on Florida’s public university system since becoming governor in 2019.\nOn Jan. 27, DeSantis issued a directive for all state and county law enforcement agencies that operate a county jail to enter into ICE’s 287(g) Program, or face suspension. The DHS initiative, included as a provision in a law signed by the Clinton administration in 1996, deputizes local law enforcement to act as immigration agents.\nOver 300 Florida agencies have finalized agreements with ICE, the largest collaboration with the federal agency by any state. Though the directive only applies to sheriff’s departments, several university police departments have opted to enter into agreements with ICE.\nCepero Lopez was devastated when she learned FIU police applied for the program. “The faculty [who] I’ve spoken with were equally distraught, disappointed, angry and just shocked,” she said.\nFaculty and students have battled for FIU’s chief of police, Alexander Casas, to end the agreement since it was first made public in April by the Miami Herald. Yet on July 2, ICE completed its end of the contract, solidifying FIU’s participation in the 287(g) Task Force Model.\nICE documents show that the model grants police the authority to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant about their status, as well as make arrests without a warrant, detain people on campus, and transport them to detention centers.\n“Our faculty, students, [and] community members do not want this agreement,” Cepero Lopez said, stressing that universities should serve as places where faculty and students are free to teach and to learn.\nThe 287(g) Task Force Model was discontinued in 2012 by the Obama administration after the Department of Justice concluded that police departments engaged in a “pattern and practice” of constitutional violations. In 2022, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report detailing “widespread” racial profiling among law enforcement agencies that participated in 287(g).\nAdvocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.\nThough FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.\nThomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance. Florida’s public universities have “become places of political patronage for DeSantis and his allies,” according to Kennedy.\nIn recent years, numerous presidents and board members with ties to DeSantis or the Republican Party, have been appointed at universities, including FIU. The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.\nCasas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”\nCasas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.\nThe television screen lit up with the name, “Donald Trump.” It was 2016. Christopher just learned who would be the next U.S. president.\n“Who is going to save my family?” he wondered as he lay next to his mother in the bed they shared. She had only recently received her green card.\nChristopher, a child of immigrants who is using a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Prism that his family experienced a “perfect storm of social issues,” including poverty, the high cost of education, and varying immigration statuses. In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.\nBut during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”\nSo Christopher again pursued higher education  and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.\nBut now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.\n“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”\nSt. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.\nAfter Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”\nAfter learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.\n“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”\nOn May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.\nUniversity leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.\nCruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.\nSurveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.\n“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.\nUniversity spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.\nBut Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.\n“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.\n“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”\nBeyond Trump’s extreme deportation agenda is a shift in how universities are working with federal and local law enforcement. The Palestine movement triggered an upheaval in universities calling police on their students and expanding on-campus surveillance.\nWhen Trump returned to the presidency in January, he signed a series of executive orders further criminalizing international students’ speech and leveraging existing anti-terrorism law already used for decades to suppress Palestine activism. Conveniently, the laws now frame the student movement as a threat to national security.\nAs the country’s national security framework returns to its anti-immigrant roots, it brings to the forefront how often universities and schools are tapped to support and uphold federal agencies’ xenophobic agendas.\nDegree programs funnel students into homeland security agencies. Agency-sponsored awards familiarize students — even high schoolers — with careers spent policing borders.\nThese efforts stem from higher education’s deep investment in American militarism and imperialism. During the 1960s, universities contributed research to the development of bombs used in Vietnam and allowed military contractors to recruit employees on their campuses, issues that continue to shape today’s divestment and anti-genocide movements.\n“The mass public thinks that higher education is challenging the state,” said one professor who has studied campus policing for 10 years and asked not to be named out of concern for retaliation by the Trump administration. “There are less examples of that, and more examples of universities complying and being an arm of the state — [one] that’s better educated, cloaked in kindness, and good language.”\nBut for every university that is deepening ties with immigration agencies, there are others, including many in California, informing faculty and students of their rights and offering online classes to keep education accessible. At colleges outside of Florida, faculty members are leading efforts to keep university police from assisting ICE.\nState University of New York (SUNY) faculty recently launched a campaign to pressure the entire school system to implement free legal counsel for immigrants and designate private spaces where agents cannot enter without a warrant. The initiative, led by a loose network of SUNY faculty that includes some at Stony Brook University (SBU) on Long Island, comes as SBU faculty fight to establish oversight of their university’s expanding surveillance capabilities.\nThe school’s former president, Maury McInnis, who now works at Yale, implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) department led by law enforcement. ERM is designed to oversee several university services and assess their risks to safety, security, and the institution’s overall brand. But exactly how it assesses risk remains unclear.\n“It’s a public university, and we don’t know what ERM is doing,” said Josh Dubnau, a professor at SBU. “Then we started seeing surveillance coming.”\nFaculty members discovered that ERM was looking to hire an intelligence specialist. According to the job posting, preferred qualifications included experience with several surveillance technology platforms like Shadow Dragon, a social media tool that collects vast amounts of data.\nWithout transparency over ERM’s internal operations, faculty worry that whatever data ERM collects could be used to assist ICE, suppress speech, and hinder academic freedom.\nRobert Chase, associate professor of history at SBU and editor of “Caging Borders and Carceral States: Incarcerations, Immigration Detentions and Resistance,” said the combined moment of Palestine protests and immigration deportations will accelerate a “new apparatus” of campus policing, where students and faculty will be assessed “through the lens not of free speech or academic freedom, but of risk and national security threats.”\n“What we say, how we speak, our political words that we use are something that law enforcement is going to … have instant access to,” Chase explained. “To read and map out our lives, our affiliation, our ideas across time. We’re seeing that as a political thing on the national level, but it has implications on the international level when we think about visas, migrant detention, deportation, and criminal implications on our students.”\nLawrence Zacarese, vice president of ERM, did not respond to a list of questions about faculty concerns, the intelligence specialist job posting, or whether the department has established any protocols against sharing information with immigration agents.\nAs universities further entangle themselves with the state, their decisions gravely impact the future of equal access to education. So far, preserving access is not being championed by university leaders, but by the students they welcomed to their schools, the faculty they employed to teach, and the people who believed they would feel at home on their campuses.\nThis includes people like Cruz, Christopher, and Cepero Lopez, who — in the face of rapidly expanding state power — refuse to accept it as normal.\n“We have to unite to confront this adversary head on,” Christopher said. “We will defend our people.”\nDisclosure: Julia Luz Betancourt graduated from St. John’s in 2022 and signed the petition demanding the university sever its relationship with CBP.\nWith Trump’s fascist agenda driving the narrative, it’s the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.\nYet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.\nBut during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”\nSo Christopher again pursued higher education  and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.\nBut now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.\n“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”\nSt. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.\nAfter Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”\nAfter learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.\n“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”\nOn May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.\nUniversity leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.\nCruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.\nSurveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.\n“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.\nUniversity spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.\nBut Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.\n“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.\n“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”\nBeyond Trump’s extreme deportation agenda is a shift in how universities are working with federal and local law enforcement. The Palestine movement triggered an upheaval in universities calling police on their students and expanding on-campus surveillance.\nWhen Trump returned to the presidency in January, he signed a series of executive orders further criminalizing international students’ speech and leveraging existing anti-terrorism law already used for decades to suppress Palestine activism. Conveniently, the laws now frame the student movement as a threat to national security.\nAs the country’s national security framework returns to its anti-immigrant roots, it brings to the forefront how often universities and schools are tapped to support and uphold federal agencies’ xenophobic agendas.\nDegree programs funnel students into homeland security agencies. Agency-sponsored awards familiarize students — even high schoolers — with careers spent policing borders.\nThese efforts stem from higher education’s deep investment in American militarism and imperialism. During the 1960s, universities contributed research to the development of bombs used in Vietnam and allowed military contractors to recruit employees on their campuses, issues that continue to shape today’s divestment and anti-genocide movements.\n“The mass public thinks that higher education is challenging the state,” said one professor who has studied campus policing for 10 years and asked not to be named out of concern for retaliation by the Trump administration. “There are less examples of that, and more examples of universities complying and being an arm of the state — [one] that’s better educated, cloaked in kindness, and good language.”\nBut for every university that is deepening ties with immigration agencies, there are others, including many in California, informing faculty and students of their rights and offering online classes to keep education accessible. At colleges outside of Florida, faculty members are leading efforts to keep university police from assisting ICE.\nState University of New York (SUNY) faculty recently launched a campaign to pressure the entire school system to implement free legal counsel for immigrants and designate private spaces where agents cannot enter without a warrant. The initiative, led by a loose network of SUNY faculty that includes some at Stony Brook University (SBU) on Long Island, comes as SBU faculty fight to establish oversight of their university’s expanding surveillance capabilities.\nThe school’s former president, Maury McInnis, who now works at Yale, implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) department led by law enforcement. ERM is designed to oversee several university services and assess their risks to safety, security, and the institution’s overall brand. But exactly how it assesses risk remains unclear.\n“It’s a public university, and we don’t know what ERM is doing,” said Josh Dubnau, a professor at SBU. “Then we started seeing surveillance coming.”\nFaculty members discovered that ERM was looking to hire an intelligence specialist. According to the job posting, preferred qualifications included experience with several surveillance technology platforms like Shadow Dragon, a social media tool that collects vast amounts of data.\nWithout transparency over ERM’s internal operations, faculty worry that whatever data ERM collects could be used to assist ICE, suppress speech, and hinder academic freedom.\nRobert Chase, associate professor of history at SBU and editor of “Caging Borders and Carceral States: Incarcerations, Immigration Detentions and Resistance,” said the combined moment of Palestine protests and immigration deportations will accelerate a “new apparatus” of campus policing, where students and faculty will be assessed “through the lens not of free speech or academic freedom, but of risk and national security threats.”\n“What we say, how we speak, our political words that we use are something that law enforcement is going to … have instant access to,” Chase explained. “To read and map out our lives, our affiliation, our ideas across time. We’re seeing that as a political thing on the national level, but it has implications on the international level when we think about visas, migrant detention, deportation, and criminal implications on our students.”\nLawrence Zacarese, vice president of ERM, did not respond to a list of questions about faculty concerns, the intelligence specialist job posting, or whether the department has established any protocols against sharing information with immigration agents.\nAs universities further entangle themselves with the state, their decisions gravely impact the future of equal access to education. So far, preserving access is not being championed by university leaders, but by the students they welcomed to their schools, the faculty they employed to teach, and the people who believed they would feel at home on their campuses.\nThis includes people like Cruz, Christopher, and Cepero Lopez, who — in the face of rapidly expanding state power — refuse to accept it as normal.\n“We have to unite to confront this adversary head on,” Christopher said. “We will defend our people.”\nDisclosure: Julia Luz Betancourt graduated from St. John’s in 2022 and signed the petition demanding the university sever its relationship with CBP.\nWith Trump’s fascist agenda driving the narrative, it’s the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.\nYet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

    "title": "Victims of mis sold car finance could get less tha 20250804 050124",
    "content": "Victims of car finance mis-selling will likely get less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the financial regulator, with the first payouts expected next year.\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Friday that hidden commissions from lenders to dealers on car loans were not unlawful, meaning millions of motorists will not be able to claim.\nHowever, the judgement left open the possibility of compensation claims for particularly large commissions which the Supreme Court said were unfair.\nFollowing the ruling, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will consult on running a payout scheme - estimated to cost between £9bn and £18bn.\nThe FCA said it was \"hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme\", but it is understood that millions could be eligible.\nThe industry is expected to cover the full costs of any potential compensation scheme, including any administrative costs.\nThose who have already complained do not need to do anything, the regulator said, advising those who have yet to complain to contact their car loan provider rather than using a claims management company.\nIt added that it \"anticipate[s] requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do\" and that claims \"should cover agreements dating back to 2007\".\nHowever, the Finance & Leasing Association has said it is concerned \"about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information\".\nThe FCA said it will start its consultation on who should be eligible for compensation and how much they should get in October, adding that the Supreme Court ruling provided \"clarity\".\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court reversed earlier court rulings which said that hidden commissions on car loans were unlawful.\nThe case was brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa's FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won a Court of Appeal case in October.\nHowever, the Supreme Court ruled that if commission is extremely high, such as in the case brought by Marcus Johnson, where the commission paid to the dealer was 55% of the total charge or credit including interest and fees - that this was a \"powerful indication\" the relationship between Mr Johnson and lender FirstRand was unfair.\nThe Supreme Court awarded Mr Johnson the amount of a commission plus interest.\nThe FCA said Friday's judgement \"helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts\".\nFCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said: \"It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\"\nHe said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\"\n\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer. \nThese were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).\nThe FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.\nSince January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.\nSome 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.\nFollowing the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \"if they were not properly disclosed\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.\nIt added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\".\nThe vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.\nIn February, Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court case over concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.\nThe FCA said on Sunday that it expects \"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\".\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will consult on running a payout scheme.\nBBC News has spoken to a range of experts to look at where you stand with cancellations and insurance. \nLenders no longer face the prospect of having to pay £30bn to £40bn to aggrieved car buyers, but the industry still faces hefty payouts.\nThe Supreme Court partially upholds an appeal from lenders, who had faced potentially paying compensation to millions of motorists.\nThe Supreme Court's decision due later could pave the way for millions of drivers to claim payouts.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Water polo  A cult or a sport  20250804 060744",
    "content": "LOGIN\nAs yet another school holiday approaches, interrupted by a sports tour, many readers may come to the conclusion that their school-going child has joined a cult. I am, of course, referring to the water polo team.\nWhat was once a minor sport at school has inexplicably risen to cult status among any school with an Olympic size swimming pool (so no township schools then). Like any cult, water polo now demands absolute loyalty from its followers. Rituals include attending practices at 6am or 8pm on a Friday night (presumably to deprive the participants and their parents of rest) and endless tournaments, especially during long weekends and school holidays. Failure to attend any of these rituals leads to possible excommunication (from the team).\nSeparating followers from society is the aim of any cult. Water polo achieves this in spades. Parents are easily sucked into the cult, lured by the attraction that their kids cannot play water polo with a screen glued to their face.\nAs a result, family friends can no longer attend social occasions because little Johnny or Susie is at a practice, a match or a tournament (and we don’t want him/her/them excommunicated).\nOrganising a get-together with friends involves weeks of planning to find those precious few hours when there is not a water polo something-or-other happening that day.\nFamilies may also be affected, with the achievements of less sporty siblings being ignored or them being relegated to schlepping to every water polo event to support their better-performing brother or sister — and don’t think they will ever forget (or forgive) this.\nAnd then there is the “us” versus “them” on which every cult relies to protect its existence. Those who are not members of the water polo fraternity are denied the smugness of saying “see you at the next event in Joburg/Durban/Cape Town/PE” followed by a look of surprise (or is that envy) that the “outsiders” are not attending.\nThose who dare question the devotion required of the sport are seen as promoting laziness over healthy exercise and no one wants to be accused of this.\nMoving up the hierarchy is another characteristic of a cult. First team, junior provincial and junior national team attainment remain the ultimate goal of any follower, but not before you have paid homage at the high altar of “the tour to Croatia”, the reasons for which are never to be questioned.

    "title": "Water polo  A cult or a sport  20250804 061821",
    "content": "LOGIN\nAs yet another school holiday approaches, interrupted by a sports tour, many readers may come to the conclusion that their school-going child has joined a cult. I am, of course, referring to the water polo team.\nWhat was once a minor sport at school has inexplicably risen to cult status among any school with an Olympic size swimming pool (so no township schools then). Like any cult, water polo now demands absolute loyalty from its followers. Rituals include attending practices at 6am or 8pm on a Friday night (presumably to deprive the participants and their parents of rest) and endless tournaments, especially during long weekends and school holidays. Failure to attend any of these rituals leads to possible excommunication (from the team).\nSeparating followers from society is the aim of any cult. Water polo achieves this in spades. Parents are easily sucked into the cult, lured by the attraction that their kids cannot play water polo with a screen glued to their face.\nAs a result, family friends can no longer attend social occasions because little Johnny or Susie is at a practice, a match or a tournament (and we don’t want him/her/them excommunicated).\nOrganising a get-together with friends involves weeks of planning to find those precious few hours when there is not a water polo something-or-other happening that day.\nFamilies may also be affected, with the achievements of less sporty siblings being ignored or them being relegated to schlepping to every water polo event to support their better-performing brother or sister — and don’t think they will ever forget (or forgive) this.\nAnd then there is the “us” versus “them” on which every cult relies to protect its existence. Those who are not members of the water polo fraternity are denied the smugness of saying “see you at the next event in Joburg/Durban/Cape Town/PE” followed by a look of surprise (or is that envy) that the “outsiders” are not attending.\nThose who dare question the devotion required of the sport are seen as promoting laziness over healthy exercise and no one wants to be accused of this.\nMoving up the hierarchy is another characteristic of a cult. First team, junior provincial and junior national team attainment remain the ultimate goal of any follower, but not before you have paid homage at the high altar of “the tour to Croatia”, the reasons for which are never to be questioned. Other than the roughly R60  000 cost to parents and vast amounts of seemingly unsupervised time for the youngsters, a visit to Croatia seems to have little effect on the quality of the water polo played on the return home.\nWhile this is an obvious tongue-in-cheek look at one sport, water polo, there is some science to the scrutiny of the cult-like devotion required today from young participants in sporting activities.\nFor the longest time, we have been told that success in sport requires a single-minded, all-in approach.

While Union Home Minister and BJP leader Amit Shah said the Assembly polls have witnessed less violence than the 2018 panchayat polls, Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee pointed out that the ongoing polls have seen far more violence with central forces deployed at polling booths opening fire.\nViolence has been reported in all four phases of elections so far, including killings of both TMC and BJP workers. However, the fourth phase on Saturday which saw five persons killed at Sitalkuchi in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district has turned the spotlight on the violence. Four youths of the victims died when Central Armed Forces opened fire at a polling booth in Jor Pakti gram panchayat in the district.\nAn estimate, compiled by Professor of Political Science at Rabindra Bharati University Biswanath Chakraborty, based on media reports, points out that, 25 people have lost their lives in poll-related violence so far from the day notification for polls was issued upto April 11.\nOf the 25 deceased, 11 are supporters of Trinamool Congress, 13 of the BJP and one is a nine-year-old child who died when a crude bomb exploded near his house, he said.\nAccording to Prof Chakraborty, who is also a psephologist, so far 34 candidates have been attacked. Four Trinamool Congress candidates, two from the Indian Secular Front, two from Congress and one from Left parties were attacked.\n“Neither Mamata Banerjee can avoid responsibility from the violence nor can Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The comparisons that these elections are less violent or more violent than panchayat polls also serve no purpose,” he said.\nProf Chakraborty, who says that Bengal has a history of violence being intrinsically linked to the poll process, feels that all parties should come on one platform and appeal to their supporters to refrain from violence.\n“This poll-related violence in West Bengal appears to be in sharp contradiction to the social religious and spiritual reform movements in the State where all political parties refer to names like Shri Chaitanya Deb, Ramakrishna Paramhansa and much later Raja Rammohun Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar,” senior journalist Biswajit Bhattacharya said.\nAfter independence, the main opposition party in the State, the Communist Party of India, went underground in the 1950s and the Naxal movement rocked the State in the 1960s and 1970s, he recalled, adding that in the Assembly polls of 1972 there was widespread violence and rigging under Congress rule.\nExperts and political commentators point out that the 2018 panchayat polls where the Trinamool Congress won 34% seats uncontested and witnessed unprecedented violence. Mr. Bhattacharya said the seeds of the violence in panchayat polls were sown in 2003 when Left parties won considerable seats without contest.\nProf. Chakraborty said during the Left front regime violence was “strategically against the political opponents and the party was the tool”.\n“The Left failed to successfully use the violence in the Darjeeling hills in 1980s and in Singur and Nandigram,” he said resulting in a regime change in 2011.\nUnlike the Left regime where violence was used only for electoral purpose, the Trinamool Congress has legitimised it in all walks of life including in university and college elections, added Prof. Chakraborty.\nBoth experts agreed that West Bengal is caught in a vicious circle of violence and area domination which is reflected whenever any elections are held.\nPublished - April 12, 2021 08:46 pm IST\nWest Bengal\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        West Bengal Assembly Elections 2021\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

    "content": "Storm Floris is expected to bring travel disruption to the UK on Monday, with an amber weather warning set to come into force. \nSome train and ferry services have already been cancelled with more likely to be impacted, including air and road transport.\nHigh winds could pose a \"danger to life\", with most of Scotland facing an amber weather warning, which will kick in at 10:00 BST and last through to 22:00.\nThere is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST through to midnight.\nThe Met Office has predicted damage to buildings, coastlines and trees due to storm conditions.\nThat yellow warning area includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.\nMany inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\nStorm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\nOperator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.\nAvanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.\nNetwork Rail said several lines in Scotland would be closed from 12pm on Monday, with all other routes experiencing a reduced timetable and longer journey times.\nScottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.\nIn a post on X it said: \"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\"\nMeanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.\nRod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\"\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\n\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\"\nShe added: \"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\"\nNational Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.\nStrong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.\nLast year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.\nIn 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.\nIn 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\".\nThese two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.\nAll four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.\nThe first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "What Every Job Seeker Needs To Know About Headhunt 20250804 060445",
    "content": "ByLiz Ryan\nByLiz Ryan,\nFormer Contributor.\nBefore you decide \"I need to meet a headhunter who'll find me a new job\" you need to understand how the third-party search business works.\nEmployers pay third-party recruiters, sometimes called search consultants or headhunters, when they don't think they can fill a job opening on their own. Sometimes they try to fill the position on their own and they can't find anyone they want to hire, so they get their search partners involved.\nIt is important to remember that recruiters work for their clients, the way all consultants do. They don't work for the job candidates they collaborate with, although job candidates are naturally a critical piece of the puzzle for search consultants.\nStill, the employer pays the bills. This is why job-seekers are often disappointed when recruiters they meet aren't always thrilled to give the job-seekers tons of free career coaching. It's not that recruiters are stingy with their advice, or uncaring.\nIt's just that there are lots of job-seekers to help, and recruiters don't get paid when they aren't placing people into new jobs. Some recruiters are difficult, of course. Some of them are terse and some are mean. It's that way in any profession.\nI'm an HR person. Do you think I'm going to sit here and try to tell you that every HR person is a warm, compassionate and wise evangelist for employees? Attorneys get slammed as rapacious sharks, used-car salespeople get tagged as hucksters. Every field and career path has great people in it, and other people who struggle to show their human qualities. It will always be that way.\nStill, people judge recruiters unfairly, because to make it as a recruiter you have to have a lot more than a phone number and a stream of jive. You have to understand what a client is telling you they need when they can't articulate it themselves.\nYou have to deal with client needs that can change dramatically overnight -- even in the middle of a search! -- and candidates who flake out, who tell you they're excited about the job and then don't show up for the interview, or who tell you at the last minute before the job offer comes \"I think I might start my own business, instead.\"\nThere are two ways to be a third-party recruiter. You can work by yourself or in a firm with other people doing contingency search. If you're a contingency recruiter, you don't get paid unless your candidate accepts the job offer. You get a commission when that happens, equivalent to about 25% of the new hire's first year cash compensation.\nWhat does it  mean to only get paid when your candidate takes the offer? It means you may be competing with a bunch of other recruiters who also have candidates applying for the same job.\nIt means staying on top of the hiring manager without irritating the manager so badly that s/he stops returning your calls -- even if you were promised feedback on a candidate by last Friday afternoon, and it's now four days later.\nThere is a lot of finesse in recruiting.\nThe other way to recruit is to work for a retained search firm, or become a retained search consultant and work solo. Retained search people are hired by the employer to fill certain positions, often high-level jobs that pay upwards of USD $10oK per year in salary.\nWhen you're hired to conduct a retained search, you're hired -- you're not competing with any other recruiters or search firms at that point.

    "title": "What Every Job Seeker Needs To Know About Headhunt 20250804 061339",
    "content": "ByLiz Ryan\nByLiz Ryan,\nFormer Contributor.\nBefore you decide \"I need to meet a headhunter who'll find me a new job\" you need to understand how the third-party search business works.\nEmployers pay third-party recruiters, sometimes called search consultants or headhunters, when they don't think they can fill a job opening on their own. Sometimes they try to fill the position on their own and they can't find anyone they want to hire, so they get their search partners involved.\nIt is important to remember that recruiters work for their clients, the way all consultants do. They don't work for the job candidates they collaborate with, although job candidates are naturally a critical piece of the puzzle for search consultants.\nStill, the employer pays the bills. This is why job-seekers are often disappointed when recruiters they meet aren't always thrilled to give the job-seekers tons of free career coaching. It's not that recruiters are stingy with their advice, or uncaring.\nIt's just that there are lots of job-seekers to help, and recruiters don't get paid when they aren't placing people into new jobs. Some recruiters are difficult, of course. Some of them are terse and some are mean. It's that way in any profession.\nI'm an HR person. Do you think I'm going to sit here and try to tell you that every HR person is a warm, compassionate and wise evangelist for employees? Attorneys get slammed as rapacious sharks, used-car salespeople get tagged as hucksters. Every field and career path has great people in it, and other people who struggle to show their human qualities. It will always be that way.\nStill, people judge recruiters unfairly, because to make it as a recruiter you have to have a lot more than a phone number and a stream of jive. You have to understand what a client is telling you they need when they can't articulate it themselves.\nYou have to deal with client needs that can change dramatically overnight -- even in the middle of a search! -- and candidates who flake out, who tell you they're excited about the job and then don't show up for the interview, or who tell you at the last minute before the job offer comes \"I think I might start my own business, instead.\"\nThere are two ways to be a third-party recruiter. You can work by yourself or in a firm with other people doing contingency search. If you're a contingency recruiter, you don't get paid unless your candidate accepts the job offer. You get a commission when that happens, equivalent to about 25% of the new hire's first year cash compensation.\nWhat does it  mean to only get paid when your candidate takes the offer? It means you may be competing with a bunch of other recruiters who also have candidates applying for the same job.\nIt means staying on top of the hiring manager without irritating the manager so badly that s/he stops returning your calls -- even if you were promised feedback on a candidate by last Friday afternoon, and it's now four days later.\nThere is a lot of finesse in recruiting.\nThe other way to recruit is to work for a retained search firm, or become a retained search consultant and work solo. Retained search people are hired by the employer to fill certain positions, often high-level jobs that pay upwards of USD $10oK per year in salary.\nWhen you're hired to conduct a retained search, you're hired -- you're not competing with any other recruiters or search firms at that point. You still have to hustle to bring in candidates the employer will love.\nWhen one of those candidates is hired, the search assignment is completed. When we occasionally conduct searches for our clients at Human Workplace, this is the kind of recruiting we do.\nWhen you get a call at work or at home from a recruiter about a job opportunity, your excitement may impel you to say \"Sure!

    "content": "Authored by Savannah Hulsey Pointer via The Epoch Times,\nA synthetic opioid derived from the kratom plant sold in gummies, tablets, and drink mixes is slated to be restricted because of concerns that it has a serious potential for abuse.\nThe compound is called 7-hydroxymitragynine, commonly known as 7-OH. It occurs naturally in trace amounts in kratom. Products containing 7-OH have potentially dangerous, enhanced levels and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the recommendation on June 29, stating that the 7-OH should be scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act because of its ability to bind to opioid receptors, which makes it a pain reliever that can be more powerful than morphine.\nHHS noted that it is focused on a concentrated byproduct of the kratom plant and not natural kratom products.\nHere’s what to know about the synthetic opioid.\nA variety of products contain 7-OH, including gummies, drink mixes, and shots. While the substance occurs naturally in kratom, it is in trace amounts.\nA product also known as 7-hydroxy, 7-OHMG, and “7,”  7-OH is a powerful psychoactive compound added to products in concentrated amounts and, according to the FDA, falsely marketed as kratom. The agency stated that it is “engineered to be addictive” and is a “potent opioid by design.”\nAccording to the FDA, Americans have reported side effects, including dependency, withdrawal, overdose, and death.\n“7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said. “We need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic.”\nKratom itself is a plant native to Southeast Asia that has been used by consumers to treat pain, anxiety, and even drug dependence.\nRegulators have had kratom in their sights for about 10 years because of concerns about potential negative effects. Both distributors and users have opposed possible regulation, saying kratom is a safer alternative to opioid use to treat pain and drug addiction.\nThe FDA stated that 7-OH is not approved for the treatment of pain, depression, anxiety, or other disorders, nor is it approved to treat opioid or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor withdrawal symptoms.\nThe availability of 7-OH in products has been a concern of the FDA because it can be purchased online and in local corner stores and vape shops. The department is particularly concerned about the availability to children and teenagers.\nAccording to officials, products with 7-OH may not be labeled clearly or accurately and might be marketed as regular kratom.\nDue to the ability of 7-OH to bind to the opioid receptors in the brain, it has highly addictive potential, according to a statement by HHS.\n“The FDA is particularly concerned with the growing market of 7-OH products that may be especially appealing to children and teenagers, such as fruit-flavored gummies and ice cream cones,” the statement reads. “These products may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.”\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said when announcing the recommendation for 7-OH restrictions that he spoke with Attorney General Pam Bondi and members of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) just days before the announcement and discovered the product was spreading to vape shops around military bases, near schools, and in low-income neighborhoods.\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) warned that 7-OH can cause a relapse for those recovering from drug addiction, recalling his experience with a family member.\n“They’re clean, they’re doing better,” he said at the July 29 press conference. “They find out they can go to a gas station or a vape shop or skate shop or bike shop, and they can find something that’s legal ... that gives them the same high, and they can still pass drug tests, even though they’re on probation.”\nThe agency’s recommendation on a new classification for 7-OH will be reviewed by the DEA, which sets the federal rules for high-risk ingredients, including both prescription medicines and illicit substances.\nIf the agency decides to enact a national ban, it wouldn’t take effect until the agency finalizes new rules that would govern the ingredient.\nThe FDA hopes to add  7-OH to the list of “scheduled” drugs to be used for medical use only, which are potentially addictive. Scheduled drugs are classified from I to V. Currently, Schedule I drugs are addictive substances such as heroin and LSD, whereas Schedule V drugs include many cough syrups.\nMarkey expects  7-OH to be considered a Schedule I drug, but that decision will be made by the DEA. The FDA, however, plans to publish a report about 7-OH, how it differs from other substances, and the potential dangers associated with consumption.\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\nAdvertising: Contact Us\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure.Here's our Cookie Policy.\nHow to report offensive comments\nNotice on Racial Discrimination.",

    "content": "Trump administration officials question data amid condemnation of dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics head.\nThe White House has defended United States President Donald Trump’s firing of the top official responsible for compiling employment statistics after her dismissal raised concerns about the future credibility of crucial economic data.\nTrump fired Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), on Friday, claiming without evidence that the latest jobs report had been “rigged” to make him look bad.\nOn Sunday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, denied that Trump was “shooting the messenger” and questioned the accuracy of the figures showing much weaker hiring than previously reported.\n“The president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers, they’re more transparent and more reliable,” Hassett told NBC News’s Meet the Press, calling the downward revision of jobs growth for May and June “unprecedented” and a “historically important outlier”.\n“And if there are big changes and big revisions – we expect more big revisions for the jobs data in September, for example – then we want to know why. We want people to explain it to us.”\nSpeaking on Fox News later on Sunday, Hassett again poured doubt on the official figures, suggesting without evidence that employment statistics can sometimes contain “partisan patterns”.\n“I think what we need is a fresh set of eyes at the BLS, somebody who can clean this thing up,” he told Fox News Sunday.\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also defended Trump’s dismissal of McEntarfer, saying the president had “real concerns” about the jobs data.\n“You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers,” Greer told CBS News’ Face the Nation.\n“There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it’s, you know, the president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.”\nThe latest employment figures released on Friday showed that 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously estimated, and that a fewer-than-expected 73,000 jobs were added in July, undermining Trump’s insistence that the economy has not been negatively affected by his sweeping tariffs.\nTrump said on Sunday that he would announce a new BLS director, as well as a candidate to fill the position left open by the resignation of Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler, within the next few days.\nTrump’s dismissal of McEntarfer, a career bureaucrat who was appointed with overwhelming bipartisan support in 2024, has prompted condemnation from economists and both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\nIn a statement on Friday, The Friends of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a group co-led by former BLS directors William Beach and Erica L Groshen, accused Trump of politicising the statistics agency and undermining confidence in official government data.\n“US official statistics are the gold standard globally,” the group said.\n“When leaders of other nations have politicised economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "content": "Trump administration officials question data amid condemnation of dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics head.\nThe White House has defended United States President Donald Trump’s firing of the top official responsible for compiling employment statistics after her dismissal raised concerns about the future credibility of crucial economic data.\nTrump fired Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), on Friday, claiming without evidence that the latest jobs report had been “rigged” to make him look bad.\nOn Sunday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, denied that Trump was “shooting the messenger” and questioned the accuracy of the figures showing much weaker hiring than previously reported.\n“The president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers, they’re more transparent and more reliable,” Hassett told NBC News’s Meet the Press, calling the downward revision of jobs growth for May and June “unprecedented” and a “historically important outlier”.\n“And if there are big changes and big revisions – we expect more big revisions for the jobs data in September, for example – then we want to know why. We want people to explain it to us.”\nSpeaking on Fox News later on Sunday, Hassett again poured doubt on the official figures, suggesting without evidence that employment statistics can sometimes contain “partisan patterns”.\n“I think what we need is a fresh set of eyes at the BLS, somebody who can clean this thing up,” he told Fox News Sunday.\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also defended Trump’s dismissal of McEntarfer, saying the president had “real concerns” about the jobs data.\n“You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers,” Greer told CBS News’ Face the Nation.\n“There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it’s, you know, the president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.”\nThe latest employment figures released on Friday showed that 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously estimated, and that a fewer-than-expected 73,000 jobs were added in July, undermining Trump’s insistence that the economy has not been negatively affected by his sweeping tariffs.\nTrump said on Sunday that he would announce a new BLS director, as well as a candidate to fill the position left open by the resignation of Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler, within the next few days.\nTrump’s dismissal of McEntarfer, a career bureaucrat who was appointed with overwhelming bipartisan support in 2024, has prompted condemnation from economists and both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\nIn a statement on Friday, The Friends of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a group co-led by former BLS directors William Beach and Erica L Groshen, accused Trump of politicising the statistics agency and undermining confidence in official government data.\n“US official statistics are the gold standard globally,” the group said.\n“When leaders of other nations have politicised economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

They’re locked into the computer system.” Beach added that the firing “really hurts the statistical system” and “undermines credibility in BLS.” In a post on X, Beach called the firing “totally groundless” and said it “sets a dangerous precedent.”\nFormer BLS commissioner @BeachWW453 on Trump firing his successor over weak jobs numbers: “I don't think there's any grounds at all for this for this firing.

    "content": "This week, the Fed held rates steady for the eighth straight meeting…\nSource: g0d4ather via Shutterstock\nEditor’s Note: Sometimes, the biggest risks in the market aren’t the ones flashing red – they’re the slow burns hiding in plain sight.\nRight now, my InvestorPlace colleague Louis Navellier believes that the Federal Reserve’s refusal to cut rates may be exactly that.\nHe is joining us today to unpack why he thinks Jerome Powell’s cautious stance is potentially dangerous for growth, earnings, and investor returns.\nWith inflation cooling, global central banks easing, and warning lights flashing across key economic indicators, Louis argues that the Fed’s delay could soon have real consequences.\nBut as always, where there’s risk, there’s also opportunity.\nTake it away, Louis…\nEvery Fed Chair gets remembered for something.\nPaul Volcker tamed inflation in the 1980s.\nAlan Greenspan presided over the dot-com boom and bust in the 1990s through the early 2000s.\nBen Bernanke battled the financial crisis.\nJanet Yellen’s time was short-lived, but she was the first female chief of the Federal Reserve.\nAs for Jerome Powell?\nIf President Trump has anything to say about, his entire legacy will boil down to two words: too late.\nAnd you know what? He has a point.\nPowell was too late to hike key interest rates when inflation was building during the pandemic in 2021.\nToo late to admit that “transitory” wasn’t the right call when describing inflation and the Fed’s lack of action. Mind you, this was after the federal government unleashed a historic wave of stimulus. Not to mention the fact that containerships dotted the horizon in most ports across the country in late 2021 when supply chains were messed up around the world.\nAnd now? Powell is too late again – this time to cut rates.\nWe saw more of that story unfold this week. On Wednesday, the Fed held rates steady for the eighth straight meeting, despite persistent signs that inflation is easing and growth is starting to slow.\nToday, I’ll recap this week’s Fed meeting and explain my frustration with the Fed. I’ll also detail why the warning signs are flashing in the data. Then, we’ll go over the latest inflation numbers, which were released this week. And finally, I’ll offer my take on what comes next – and how you can best position yourself to profit.\nLet’s start with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that wrapped up this Wednesday.\nThe Fed held interest rates steady – again. That makes the fifth meeting in a row with no change, leaving the fed funds rate stuck in a range of 4.25% – 4.50% since December 2024.\nNow, on paper, Powell and the rest of the FOMC are saying the right things: they’re “data dependent,” they’ll “remain vigilant,” and so on.\nSo, the good news is the Fed acknowledged the economy is softer, but it’s not enough to cut rates yet.\nI should add that some members of the FOMC see the light. Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissented in the vote. That’s a big deal, because it’s the first time two voting members have split with Fed leadership in three decades.\nNow, before I go any further, I want to be blunt about something.\nMost of the Fed is living in a delusional world.\nThey’re looking for an inflation bogeyman that doesn’t exist – and in the process, they’re ignoring the signals right in front of them.\nBut before I go any further, let’s dive into this week’s inflation numbers. Then, hopefully, you’ll see what I mean.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index report was released this morning.\nNow, this is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. Our central bank has expressed in the past that it would like to see it clock in at 2%, especially with regard to “core” inflation.\nCore PCE, which strips out food and energy, rose 0.3% in June. Economists were looking for 0.2%, and it’s also the biggest monthly jump since January. On a year-over-year basis, core PCE is now running at 2.8% – exactly where it was the month before, when accounting for the upward revision in this report.\nSo, while it’s not ideal, it’s not accelerating, either.\nNow, let’s dig into the underlying economic data from the same report:\nSo, yes, we did have a slight surprise in the numbers with this report. But the reality is that inflation is not running wild. Meanwhile, growth is starting to sputter.\nAside from this week’s report, inflation has been consistently coming in below expectations. For example, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has come in below what economists expected for five straight months.\nI’ve been pointing this out again and again – and yet the Fed keeps ignoring it.\nWhy is that happening? One is that there’s deflation in China. Two, there was a buildup of inventories trying to beat the tariffs. Three, economies around the world are weak, and it is very hard to increase prices. Four, the dollar is getting its mojo back – and its appreciation in the next year or so is going to more than offset the tariffs. Period.\nStill, Jerome Powell insists there’s “a long way to go.” He even said during his press conference that it’s “too early” to understand the impact of tariffs, as if he’s waiting for some phantom inflation spike to justify keeping rates high.\nBut the reality is that nearly all of our inflation in America is related to real estate. And real estate prices are getting slashed across most of the country as we speak. There’s a glut of rental properties now, too. So, hopefully, the owner’s equivalent rent component in the CPI report will crack soon. And when it does, inflation could fall well below the Fed’s 2% target rate.\nAnother reason we need to be cutting rates is the fact that global interest rates are falling.\nThe European Central Bank is cutting rates. The Bank of England is expected to follow. Even China, which has its own mess to deal with, is slashing rates.\nThat leaves us with some of the highest real rates in the developed world. And that has consequences. It strengthens the dollar (which isn’t all bad), but it also creates distortions. Growth starts to slow. Earnings start to wobble. And capital starts looking for safer, more productive ground.\nIn the wake of the Fed meeting and the PCE data, the market got the message.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s now a 61% chance the Fed holds rates steady – up from just 40% a week ago, and 5% a month ago.\nBut here’s the bottom line…\nThe Fed is squinting at the data through the wrong lens. They need to cut in September, again in December, and four more times next year.\nThey need to get the federal funds rate down to about 3%. And if they keep waiting, they risk breaking something.\nSo, what does all this mean?\nIt means the Fed is behind the curve – again. But this time, markets aren’t going to wait around.\nSmart money is already repositioning. And a quiet policy shift from Washington is about to accelerate that trend even more.\nEarlier this year, President Trump signed a directive that laid the groundwork for a new kind of national investment strategy.\nEven though it hasn’t made headlines yet, I believe it’s one of the most important federal initiatives of the past decade.\nThat’s because, in short, I believe it’s going to lead to the creation of the first-ever sovereign wealth fund in the U.S. So, instead of taxing or borrowing more, the MAGA Fund taps into assets the government already owns – land, resources, infrastructure – and begins deploying capital into companies strategically aligned with national priorities.\nAnd right now, a select group of public companies is already benefiting from this shift.\nI just released a new report with all the details – and I want you to see it for yourself.\nClick here now to watch my full briefing and learn how you can position your portfolio now.\nSincerely,\nLouis Navellier\nEditor, Market 360\nBy looking for big-picture trends that drive huge, multiyear moves in entire sectors of the market, Eric Fry exploits moneymaking opportunities regular Wall Streeters miss.\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/smartmoney/2025/08/why-this-investing-legend-thinks-the-feds-delay-in-cutting-rates-is-a-mistake/.\n©2025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nAll rights reserved.

    "title": "Why traditional VC is failing deep tech   and what 20250804 060451",
    "content": "Nikolay Shestak, partner at Zubr Capital, warns European venture capital must evolve to ensure deep tech thrives\nEurope’s deep tech future hinges on evolving investment strategies. The reason for this is that traditional funding models cannot support the long-term financial commitments that innovation demands. There is a European paradox where, despite substantial scientific research, early commercialisation and a focus on shorter-term goals prevent the region from realising the full potential of deep tech. Although startups provide strong support, the sector still lags behind the US and Asia in bringing breakthroughs from the lab to market.\nTo maintain a competitive industry, Europe needs to advance technologies like AI, robotics, synthetic biology, and quantum computing, which are at the heart of the deep tech sector. These technologies aren’t just profitable. They can transform the world, from cochlear implants restoring hearing to aerospace engineering enabling missions to Mars. But none of these advances happen without patient, long-term investment in science, engineering, and design.\nStartups focused on rapid-deployment SaaS or consumer apps can commercialise quickly and attract early investment. Deep tech is different: there’s a “valley of death” driven by long R&D cycles, high upfront costs, and greater risk tolerance than in traditional software ventures.\nIt’s worth examining which new funding models are working — and how they are starting to take hold in Europe. Drawing on insights from my investment practice — Zubr Capital — this analysis explores the real opportunity for Europe to leverage deep tech and reclaim lost market share, rather than see its startups move to mature financial ecosystems like the US, Asia, or Israel.\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nTraditional software startups typically follow a familiar funding cycle blueprint. It raises a 10-year fund, deploys gained capital over three to five years, and aims for lucrative investment exits within five to seven years. The startup defines a successful funding cycle based on rapid growth, scalability, and relatively low capital requirements.\nDeep tech cannot operate within this traditional financial mould. Startups operating in this category need development cycles that often exceed a decade. Regulations from subcategories like healthcare, energy, and aerospace require numerous certifications and tests to verify advanced capabilities. That is an area where generalist VCs rarely tread due to a need for patient capital.\nMost deep tech companies have to overcome specific industrial and geographical thresholds. A French aerospace firm, for instance, may not have the infrastructure to take advantage of traditional funding the way a US giant like Delta can.\nEstablished investment models present several obstacles to deep tech companies. For example:\nAnother pain point in deep tech is the reliance on education. A traditional startup leader only has two to three years of higher education. Deep tech requires about five to seven years due to the complexity of the subject matter. An overwhelming 81% of deep tech founders believe European investors lack the knowledge to really understand the in-depth details of their projects or goals.\nThere also simply isn’t enough money to offer. A European fund managing €150mn can write a few €10 to €15 mn checks, but that isn’t enough to build something as complex as a gigafactory or scale a new fusion plant. The mismatch of traditional VC funding with deep tech in Europe is what drives systemic underfunding, stalled startups, and the loss of world-changing innovations. There is a history of outside and foreign entities like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others picking up European tech talent to integrate into their R&D sectors. Those losses slow European deep tech advancement.\nThe idea of mismatched VCs isn’t theoretical. There are many real-world examples of funding failures leading to Europe losing deep tech opportunities to international competitors. Here are just a few examples.\nProphesee creates neuromorphic vision sensors that enable machines to mimic human sight. The company raised €126mn over several rounds. However, in October of 2024, Prophesee entered judicial recovery after failing to secure additional funding. Even though the startup received massive global recognition for its technical validation (proof of concept), the length and uncertainty of financing led to complications in development.\nMycorena had to file for bankruptcy and is now permanently closed. What began with the promise of mycelium-based protein that could be used in all kinds of industries failed after the startup couldn’t secure Series B funding in the mid-2020s. Mycorena was ultimately acquired for next to nothing, underscoring the hurdles deep tech companies encounter during scale-up.\nBlickfeld was an emerging leader in LiDAR, which enables autonomous vehicles to perceive their environment and operate safely. The company raised a total of €68mn — including €15mn from the European Investment Bank (EIB). But in June 2024, Blickfeld had to file for insolvency. Revenue came in too slowly to meet the demands of patient capital.\nThere are many other examples of investment shortcomings undermining promising European tech firms. Take MaaS Global in Finland, best known for the Whim app, which burned through too much capital without a sustainable business model. Or Sweden’s Northvolt, whose battery manufacturing business failed even with a blended funding model.\nThe pattern is strikingly consistent: funding dries up when capital needs spike and investors push for exits while R&D is still trying to work out the final solution. Meanwhile, public funding fails to arrive in time, and technical ambition is quickly sacrificed on the altar of short-term vitality. History is repeating itself, and deep tech is losing out.\nFor Europe to capitalise on deep tech, change must happen — and happen fast. New funding models and structures are required to meet the sector’s needs. Alternative solutions could be the final leg of the journey to overcome issues like the “valley of death” for deep tech. Which funding initiatives will get us there?\nIt is important to note that these funding models alone are still not enough. They help create vibrant, regional successes, but the fragmentation of industries leaves infrastructure gaps in different European countries. The concentration of sectors like aerospace in Germany, batteries in Sweden, and EIT deep tech talent in Spain only widens such gaps. Progress is encouraging, but geographical coverage must be balanced to overcome Europe’s “patchwork” of financial inefficiencies.\nDespite all these progressive financial models, truly innovative financial solutions remain largely absent from the deep tech ecosystem in Europe. Many think tanks, EU policy papers, and founder forums highlight the need for longer time-to-revenue projects and solutions to high upfront costs, but the current tools are not quite up to the task.\nAs of 2022, no European deep tech startup has successfully used IP-backed loans, R&D pre-purchase agreements, revenue-based financing, or advance market commitments. Such models are helpful, but have yet to tackle the challenges around scaling a business, time to market, and elevated risk profiles.\nThe dominance of traditional financial models exists because grants, equity rounds, and hybrid public-private schemes cannot account for regulatory uncertainty, lack of institutional experience, and risk aversion.\nAs a result, Europe is falling behind and will continue to do so until financial innovation moves from theoretical idea to practical application. The good news is that such adaptation is already happening elsewhere, providing a framework for Europe to follow.\nThe US and Israel are turning deep tech into operational success using practical funding tools. Take Helion Energy in the US. The company has developed advanced fusion systems and recently raised $425mn to advance this technology over the next three years. Funding milestones were introduced to de-risk capital and support pre-purchase contracts.\nAnother example of adaptive funding fueling deep tech success is Climeworks. The company has benefited from revenue-based financing through corporate carbon offset agreements. Thanks to the predictable revenue streams, investors like Microsoft and Stripe have been able to provide funding crucial for scaling Climeworks’ direct air capture technology.\nInnovative funding has also boosted Israel’s Phantom Energy. The company is using IP-backed loans to enable prototyping without dilution, leveraging patents as collateral. In every case, the funding tool is designed to “match” the technology. Europe can learn from these successes. With flexible funding that accommodates longer development cycles and eases failure risks, the continent will progress further in deep tech.\nIf Europe wants a seat at the deep tech table, it needs to change. Incremental steps, like the examples listed above, won’t be enough. Insufficient patient capital with too many funds operating on short, exit-driven cycles must give way to new models. In their place, we need pan-European “evergreen” funds, growth-stage vehicles, and public-private platforms.\nFund sizes remain too small, and financial innovation is lacking. To address this, Europe needs well-publicised pilot projects involving creative investment models, such as IP-backed finance and non-dilutive hybrid modelling.\nIf Europe fosters greater collaboration and co-investment, we can reduce fragmentation and harmonise regulations. This could speed up grant distribution and create international “fast lanes” that shift the culture from fear of risk to celebrating experimentation.\nBold action is necessary to streamline bureaucracy and build technical investing talent that feeds both VCs and deep tech startups.

    "content": "Nikolay Shestak, partner at Zubr Capital, warns European venture capital must evolve to ensure deep tech thrives\nEurope’s deep tech future hinges on evolving investment strategies. The reason for this is that traditional funding models cannot support the long-term financial commitments that innovation demands. There is a European paradox where, despite substantial scientific research, early commercialisation and a focus on shorter-term goals prevent the region from realising the full potential of deep tech. Although startups provide strong support, the sector still lags behind the US and Asia in bringing breakthroughs from the lab to market.\nTo maintain a competitive industry, Europe needs to advance technologies like AI, robotics, synthetic biology, and quantum computing, which are at the heart of the deep tech sector. These technologies aren’t just profitable. They can transform the world, from cochlear implants restoring hearing to aerospace engineering enabling missions to Mars. But none of these advances happen without patient, long-term investment in science, engineering, and design.\nStartups focused on rapid-deployment SaaS or consumer apps can commercialise quickly and attract early investment. Deep tech is different: there’s a “valley of death” driven by long R&D cycles, high upfront costs, and greater risk tolerance than in traditional software ventures.\nIt’s worth examining which new funding models are working — and how they are starting to take hold in Europe. Drawing on insights from my investment practice — Zubr Capital — this analysis explores the real opportunity for Europe to leverage deep tech and reclaim lost market share, rather than see its startups move to mature financial ecosystems like the US, Asia, or Israel.\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nTraditional software startups typically follow a familiar funding cycle blueprint. It raises a 10-year fund, deploys gained capital over three to five years, and aims for lucrative investment exits within five to seven years. The startup defines a successful funding cycle based on rapid growth, scalability, and relatively low capital requirements.\nDeep tech cannot operate within this traditional financial mould. Startups operating in this category need development cycles that often exceed a decade. Regulations from subcategories like healthcare, energy, and aerospace require numerous certifications and tests to verify advanced capabilities. That is an area where generalist VCs rarely tread due to a need for patient capital.\nMost deep tech companies have to overcome specific industrial and geographical thresholds. A French aerospace firm, for instance, may not have the infrastructure to take advantage of traditional funding the way a US giant like Delta can.\nEstablished investment models present several obstacles to deep tech companies. For example:\nAnother pain point in deep tech is the reliance on education. A traditional startup leader only has two to three years of higher education. Deep tech requires about five to seven years due to the complexity of the subject matter. An overwhelming 81% of deep tech founders believe European investors lack the knowledge to really understand the in-depth details of their projects or goals.\nThere also simply isn’t enough money to offer. A European fund managing €150mn can write a few €10 to €15 mn checks, but that isn’t enough to build something as complex as a gigafactory or scale a new fusion plant. The mismatch of traditional VC funding with deep tech in Europe is what drives systemic underfunding, stalled startups, and the loss of world-changing innovations. There is a history of outside and foreign entities like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others picking up European tech talent to integrate into their R&D sectors. Those losses slow European deep tech advancement.\nThe idea of mismatched VCs isn’t theoretical. There are many real-world examples of funding failures leading to Europe losing deep tech opportunities to international competitors. Here are just a few examples.\nProphesee creates neuromorphic vision sensors that enable machines to mimic human sight. The company raised €126mn over several rounds.

    "content": "\"We are looking at the potential to extend this current flight, Crew-11.\"\nThe next four-person team to live and work aboard the International Space Station departed from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday, taking aim at the massive orbiting research complex for a planned stay of six to eight months.\nSpacecraft commander Zena Cardman leads the mission, designated Crew-11, that lifted off from Florida's Space Coast at 11:43 am EDT (15:43 UTC) on Friday. Sitting to her right inside SpaceX's Crew Dragon Endeavour capsule was veteran NASA astronaut Mike Fincke, serving as the vehicle pilot. Flanking the commander and pilot were two mission specialists: Kimiya Yui of Japan and Oleg Platonov of Russia.\nCardman and her crewmates rode a Falcon 9 rocket off the launch pad and headed northeast over the Atlantic Ocean, lining up with the space station's orbit to set the stage for an automated docking at the complex early Saturday.\n﻿\nThe Falcon 9's reusable first stage booster detached and returned to a propulsive touchdown at Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, a few miles south of the launch site. This was the 53rd and final rocket landing at LZ-1 since SpaceX aced the first intact recovery of a Falcon 9 booster there on December 21, 2015.\nOn most of SpaceX's missions, Falcon 9 boosters land on the company's offshore drone ships hundreds of miles downrange from the launch site. For launches with enough fuel margin, the first stage can return to an onshore landing. But the Space Force, which leases out the landing zones to SpaceX, wants to convert the site of LZ-1 into a launch site for another rocket company.\nSpaceX will move onshore rocket landings to new landing zones to be constructed next to the two Falcon 9 launch pads at the Florida spaceport. Landing Zone 2, located adjacent to Landing Zone 1, will also be decommissioned and handed back over to the Space Force once SpaceX activates the new landing sites.\n\"We're working with the Cape and with the Kennedy Space Center folks to figure out the right time to make that transition from Landing Zone 2 in the future,\" said Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's vice president of build and flight reliability. \"But I think we'll stay with Landing Zone 2 at least near-term, for a little while, and then look at the right time to move to the other areas.\"\nMeanwhile, the Falcon 9's second stage fired its single engine to accelerate the Crew Dragon spacecraft into low-Earth orbit. Less than 10 minutes after liftoff, the capsule separated from the second stage to wrap up the 159th consecutive successful launch of a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\"I have no emotions but joy right now,\" Cardman said moments after arriving in orbit. \"That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime.\"\nThis is the first trip to space for Cardman, a 37-year-old geobiologist and Antarctic explorer selected as a NASA astronaut in 2017. She was assigned to command a Dragon flight to the ISS last year, but NASA bumped her and another astronaut from the mission to make room for the spacecraft to return the two astronauts left behind on the station by Boeing's troubled Starliner capsule.\nMike Fincke, 58, is beginning his fourth spaceflight after previous launches on Russian Soyuz spacecraft and NASA's space shuttle. He was previously training to fly on the Starliner spacecraft's first long-duration mission, but NASA moved him to Dragon as the Boeing program faced more delays.\n\"Boy, it’s great to be back in orbit!\" Fincke said. \"Thank you to SpaceX and NASA for getting us here. What a ride!\"\nYui is on his second flight to orbit. The 55-year-old former fighter pilot in the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force spent 141 days in space in 2015. Platonov, a 39-year-old spaceflight rookie, was a fighter pilot in the Russian Air Force before training to become a cosmonaut.\nThere's some unexpected uncertainty going into this mission about how long the foursome will be in space. Missions sometimes get extended for technical reasons, or because of poor weather in recovery zones on Earth, but there's something different in play with Crew-11. For the first time, there's a decent chance that NASA will stretch out this expedition due to money issues.\nThe Trump administration has proposed across-the-board cuts to most NASA programs, including the International Space Station. The White House's budget request for NASA in fiscal year 2026, which begins on October 1, calls for an overall cut in agency funding of nearly 25 percent.\nThe White House proposes a slightly higher reduction by percentage for the International Space Station and crew and cargo transportation to and from the research outpost. The cuts to the ISS would keep the station going through 2030, but with a smaller crew and a reduced capacity for research. Effectively, the ISS would limp toward retirement after more than 30 years in orbit.\nSteve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, said the agency's engineers are working with SpaceX to ensure the Dragon spacecraft can stay in orbit for at least eight months. The current certification limit is seven months, although officials waived the limit for one Dragon mission that lasted longer.\n\"When we launch, we have a mission duration that’s baseline,\" Stich said in a July 10 press conference. \"And then we can extend [the] mission in real-time, as needed, as we better understand… the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"\nAn update this week provided by Dana Weigel, NASA's ISS program manager, indicated that officials are still planning for Crew-11 to stay in space a little longer than usual.\n\"We are looking at the potential to extend this current flight, Crew-11,\" Weigel said Wednesday. \"There are a few more months worth of work to do first.\"\nBudget bills advanced in the Senate and House of Representatives in July would maintain funding for most NASA programs, including the ISS and transportation, close to this year's levels. But it's no guarantee that Congress will pass an appropriations bill for NASA before the deadline of midnight on October 1. It's also unknown whether President Donald Trump would sign a budget bill into law that rejects his administration's cuts.\nIf Congress doesn't act, lawmakers must pass a continuing resolution as a temporary stopgap measure or accept a government shutdown. Some members of Congress are also concerned that the Trump administration might simply refuse to spend money allotted to NASA and other federal agencies in any budget bill. This move, called impoundment, would be controversial, and its legality would likely have to be adjudicated in the courts.\nA separate amendment added in Congress to a so-called reconciliation bill and signed into law by Trump on July 4 also adds $1.25 billion for ISS operations through 2029. \"We’re still evaluating how that's going to affect operations going forward, but it's a positive step,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for space operations.\nSuffice it to say that while Congress has signaled its intention to keep funding the ISS and many other NASA programs, the amount of money the space agency will actually receive remains uncertain. Trump appointees have directed NASA managers to prepare to operate as if the White House's proposed cuts will become reality.\nFor officials in charge of the International Space Station, this means planning for fewer astronauts, reductions in research output, and longer-duration missions to minimize the number of crew rotation flights NASA must pay for. SpaceX is NASA's primary contractor for crew rotation missions, using its Dragon spacecraft. NASA has a similar contract with Boeing, but that company's Starliner spacecraft has not been certified for any operational flights to the station.\nSpaceX's next crew mission to the space station, Crew-12, is scheduled to launch early next year. Weigel said NASA is looking at the \"entire spectrum\" of options to cut back on the space station's operations and transportation costs. One of those options would be to launch three crew members on Crew-12 instead of the regular four-person complement.\n\"We don't have to answer that right now,\" Weigel said. \"We can actually wait pretty late to make the crew size smaller if we need to. In terms of cargo vehicles, we're well-supplied through this fall, so in the short term, I'd say, through the end of this year and the beginning of '26, things look pretty normal in terms of what we have planned for the program.\n\"But we're evaluating things, and we'll be ready to adjust when the budget is passed and when we figure out where we really land.\"\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Effectively, the ISS would limp toward retirement after more than 30 years in orbit.\nSteve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, said the agency's engineers are working with SpaceX to ensure the Dragon spacecraft can stay in orbit for at least eight months. The current certification limit is seven months, although officials waived the limit for one Dragon mission that lasted longer.\n\"When we launch, we have a mission duration that’s baseline,\" Stich said in a July 10 press conference. \"And then we can extend [the] mission in real-time, as needed, as we better understand… the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"\nAn update this week provided by Dana Weigel, NASA's ISS program manager, indicated that officials are still planning for Crew-11 to stay in space a little longer than usual.\n\"We are looking at the potential to extend this current flight, Crew-11,\" Weigel said Wednesday. \"There are a few more months worth of work to do first.\"\nBudget bills advanced in the Senate and House of Representatives in July would maintain funding for most NASA programs, including the ISS and transportation, close to this year's levels. But it's no guarantee that Congress will pass an appropriations bill for NASA before the deadline of midnight on October 1. It's also unknown whether President Donald Trump would sign a budget bill into law that rejects his administration's cuts.\nIf Congress doesn't act, lawmakers must pass a continuing resolution as a temporary stopgap measure or accept a government shutdown. Some members of Congress are also concerned that the Trump administration might simply refuse to spend money allotted to NASA and other federal agencies in any budget bill. This move, called impoundment, would be controversial, and its legality would likely have to be adjudicated in the courts.\nA separate amendment added in Congress to a so-called reconciliation bill and signed into law by Trump on July 4 also adds $1.25 billion for ISS operations through 2029. \"We’re still evaluating how that's going to affect operations going forward, but it's a positive step,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for space operations.\nSuffice it to say that while Congress has signaled its intention to keep funding the ISS and many other NASA programs, the amount of money the space agency will actually receive remains uncertain. Trump appointees have directed NASA managers to prepare to operate as if the White House's proposed cuts will become reality.\nFor officials in charge of the International Space Station, this means planning for fewer astronauts, reductions in research output, and longer-duration missions to minimize the number of crew rotation flights NASA must pay for. SpaceX is NASA's primary contractor for crew rotation missions, using its Dragon spacecraft. NASA has a similar contract with Boeing, but that company's Starliner spacecraft has not been certified for any operational flights to the station.\nSpaceX's next crew mission to the space station, Crew-12, is scheduled to launch early next year. Weigel said NASA is looking at the \"entire spectrum\" of options to cut back on the space station's operations and transportation costs. One of those options would be to launch three crew members on Crew-12 instead of the regular four-person complement.\n\"We don't have to answer that right now,\" Weigel said. \"We can actually wait pretty late to make the crew size smaller if we need to. In terms of cargo vehicles, we're well-supplied through this fall, so in the short term, I'd say, through the end of this year and the beginning of '26, things look pretty normal in terms of what we have planned for the program.\n\"But we're evaluating things, and we'll be ready to adjust when the budget is passed and when we figure out where we really land.\"\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "content": "\"We are looking at the potential to extend this current flight, Crew-11.\"\nThe next four-person team to live and work aboard the International Space Station departed from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday, taking aim at the massive orbiting research complex for a planned stay of six to eight months.\nSpacecraft commander Zena Cardman leads the mission, designated Crew-11, that lifted off from Florida's Space Coast at 11:43 am EDT (15:43 UTC) on Friday. Sitting to her right inside SpaceX's Crew Dragon Endeavour capsule was veteran NASA astronaut Mike Fincke, serving as the vehicle pilot. Flanking the commander and pilot were two mission specialists: Kimiya Yui of Japan and Oleg Platonov of Russia.\nCardman and her crewmates rode a Falcon 9 rocket off the launch pad and headed northeast over the Atlantic Ocean, lining up with the space station's orbit to set the stage for an automated docking at the complex early Saturday.\n﻿\nThe Falcon 9's reusable first stage booster detached and returned to a propulsive touchdown at Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, a few miles south of the launch site. This was the 53rd and final rocket landing at LZ-1 since SpaceX aced the first intact recovery of a Falcon 9 booster there on December 21, 2015.\nOn most of SpaceX's missions, Falcon 9 boosters land on the company's offshore drone ships hundreds of miles downrange from the launch site. For launches with enough fuel margin, the first stage can return to an onshore landing. But the Space Force, which leases out the landing zones to SpaceX, wants to convert the site of LZ-1 into a launch site for another rocket company.\nSpaceX will move onshore rocket landings to new landing zones to be constructed next to the two Falcon 9 launch pads at the Florida spaceport. Landing Zone 2, located adjacent to Landing Zone 1, will also be decommissioned and handed back over to the Space Force once SpaceX activates the new landing sites.\n\"We're working with the Cape and with the Kennedy Space Center folks to figure out the right time to make that transition from Landing Zone 2 in the future,\" said Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's vice president of build and flight reliability. \"But I think we'll stay with Landing Zone 2 at least near-term, for a little while, and then look at the right time to move to the other areas.\"\nMeanwhile, the Falcon 9's second stage fired its single engine to accelerate the Crew Dragon spacecraft into low-Earth orbit. Less than 10 minutes after liftoff, the capsule separated from the second stage to wrap up the 159th consecutive successful launch of a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\"I have no emotions but joy right now,\" Cardman said moments after arriving in orbit. \"That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime.\"\nThis is the first trip to space for Cardman, a 37-year-old geobiologist and Antarctic explorer selected as a NASA astronaut in 2017. She was assigned to command a Dragon flight to the ISS last year, but NASA bumped her and another astronaut from the mission to make room for the spacecraft to return the two astronauts left behind on the station by Boeing's troubled Starliner capsule.\nMike Fincke, 58, is beginning his fourth spaceflight after previous launches on Russian Soyuz spacecraft and NASA's space shuttle. He was previously training to fly on the Starliner spacecraft's first long-duration mission, but NASA moved him to Dragon as the Boeing program faced more delays.\n\"Boy, it’s great to be back in orbit!\" Fincke said. \"Thank you to SpaceX and NASA for getting us here. What a ride!\"\nYui is on his second flight to orbit. The 55-year-old former fighter pilot in the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force spent 141 days in space in 2015. Platonov, a 39-year-old spaceflight rookie, was a fighter pilot in the Russian Air Force before training to become a cosmonaut.\nThere's some unexpected uncertainty going into this mission about how long the foursome will be in space. Missions sometimes get extended for technical reasons, or because of poor weather in recovery zones on Earth, but there's something different in play with Crew-11. For the first time, there's a decent chance that NASA will stretch out this expedition due to money issues.\nThe Trump administration has proposed across-the-board cuts to most NASA programs, including the International Space Station. The White House's budget request for NASA in fiscal year 2026, which begins on October 1, calls for an overall cut in agency funding of nearly 25 percent.\nThe White House proposes a slightly higher reduction by percentage for the International Space Station and crew and cargo transportation to and from the research outpost.

Instead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee endorsed maintaining the biomedical agency’s structure and increasing its funding by US$400 million, or about 1%.\nThe details, presented in a bill released today by the committee, will probably change before the bill is signed into law. But the initial figure for the NIH, discussed at a meeting yesterday, offers yet another hint that the US Congress, which controls government spending, does not support Trump’s desire to slash US science. (Earlier this month, another Senate committee said it wanted to keep the budget for the US National Science Foundation relatively flat despite Trump’s call for a 57% reduction.)\n“Given the alternative, the Senate’s recommendation of a $400-million increase for NIH is an indication the agency still has support on Capitol Hill,” says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of public affairs at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “A 40% cut would have been devastating, so this is a good outcome in a tough year.”\nThe bill now faces several challenges. First, the full Senate must pass it. Then, the lower chamber of Congress, the US House of Representatives, will pass its own version, and the two bodies must come together to agree on a single bill that Trump is willing to sign.\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\nThe bill might also change if legislators introduce amendments before it’s sent to Trump’s desk. For example, Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator for Illinois, tried at the meeting yesterday to add a provision to reinstate billions of dollars in health-research funding that had been frozen or terminated by the Trump administration because projects — including some on COVID-19 — did not align with agency priorities.\nThe amendment failed in a vote that fell along party lines, with 14 Democrats voting for it and 15 Republicans voting against it. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican senator for West Virginia, urged her colleagues to vote against the amendment, saying that “every president has the prerogative to implement new goals and priorities”.\nNevertheless, senators at the hearing rejoiced that they could come to a bipartisan agreement to fund health agencies: “To the scientists wondering if there will even be an NIH by the end of this administration, this committee’s resounding message is: ‘Yes, Congress has your back’,” said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator for Washington state and vice-chair of the committee. “We need you to stay here and keep this research going.”\nUnder the bill, budgets for other health agencies would also remain roughly the same. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose budget the Trump administration wanted to cut by more than half, would receive $9.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2024.\nThe committee meeting comes towards the end of a tumultuous week for the NIH, after the White House blocked, and then unblocked, the agency from spending the remainder of its 2025 budget — about $15 billion — by issuing grants. With the NIH cancelling grant-review meetings in early 2025, funding processes have been delayed, and agency staff members are working in overdrive to process as many grants as possible before the end of the fiscal year on 30 September. If they don’t distribute the money, the agency will have to return the unused funds to the US Treasury.\nUS senators poised to reject Trump’s proposed massive science cuts\nUS senators poised to reject Trump’s proposed massive science cuts\nThese disruptions have drawn condemnation, and not only from Trump’s opponents: 14 Republican senators sent a letter to the White House on 25 July demanding that the NIH be allowed to spend its full 2025 budget.\nor\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-02448-3\nReprints and permissions\nExclusive: NIH to dismiss dozens of grant reviewers to align with Trump priorities\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\nUS senators poised to reject Trump’s proposed massive science cuts\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\nMy AI chatbot thinks my idea is fundable\nCareer Column 31 JUL 25\nPowerful satellite will map changes on Earth in stunning detail — down to a centimetre\nNews 30 JUL 25\nColumbia researchers eager to restart science after university’s deal with Trump\nNews 29 JUL 25\nHow China’s bold talent recruitment has shaped science\nNews 29 JUL 25\nChina reins in the spiralling construction costs of nuclear power — what can other countries learn?\nComment 28 JUL 25\nMeet the early-career scientists planning to leave the United States\nNews 25 JUL 25\nIndia to penalize universities with too many retractions\nNews 01 AUG 25\nI could not have become an astronomer on my own\nCareer Feature 01 AUG 25\nMy AI chatbot thinks my idea is fundable\nCareer Column 31 JUL 25\nPostdoc opportunity to engage in both foundational machine learning research and high-impact interdisciplinary applications in the life sciences.\nVienna, Austria\nAITHYRA GmbH - Research Institute for Biomedical Artificial Intelligence of the Austrian Academy of Sciences\nShenzhen, Guangdong (CN)\nShenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation\nShenzhen, Guangdong (CN)\nShenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation\nThe Carol and Gene Ludwig Program for the Study of Neuroimmune Interactions in Dementia at Yale School of Medicine seeks new tenure-track faculty.\nNew Haven, Connecticut\nYale School of Medicine - Ludwig Program for the Study of Neuroimmune Interaction in Dementia\n6 major schools are now hiring faculty members.\nShanghai, China\nShanghaiTech University\nExclusive: NIH to dismiss dozens of grant reviewers to align with Trump priorities\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\nUS senators poised to reject Trump’s proposed massive science cuts\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your inbox every weekday.\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter — what matters in science, free to your inbox daily.\nNature\n                    \n                    (Nature)\nISSN 1476-4687 (online)\nISSN 0028-0836 (print)\n© 2025 Springer Nature Limited",

On June 14, as Trump held a national military parade in Washington, D.C.,–the largest the capital city has seen in decades—people across the U.S. gathered for counter-action, attending \"No Kings\" protests to publicly “reject authoritarianism.” Ahead of the big day, Trump had warned that “people that want to protest will be met with big force,” saying participants are “people that hate our country.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAmid the “No Kings” activism, states across the U.S. also encountered immigration protests as people demonstrated against the Trump Administration’s ICE raids. The protests notably started in Los Angeles and garnered national and international attention, especially after Trump deployed the National Guard, and later the Marines, to quell the demonstrations, without the request of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The decision resulted in much criticism and a legal battle, with an appeals court ultimately ruling that Trump was allowed to keep control of the National Guard in L.A.\nIn April, people gathered across the U.S. and international cities such as London, Paris, and Stockholm to protest against the actions of Trump and his then-ally, former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) lead Elon Musk. (The former allies have since had a very public falling out.)\nAdvertisement\nNow, a fresh round of protests are set to take place on July 4, America’s Independence Day. Here’s what we know about the planned action.\nWomen’s March, which coordinates protests across the U.S. against sexism and oppression, has published a list of over 140 events set to take place on July 4. The displays of protest range from rallies and marches to block parties. Women’s March has invited communities across the country to create even more events.\nPer the organization, the Free America Weekend aims to highlight key issues being faced by people across the U.S., such as poverty, unlawful orders, and “the grip of hate and the politics of fear.”\n\"This July 4th, while the U.S. marks Independence Day, we’ll gather across the country—on porches, in town squares, backyards, and streets—to stand for real freedom and build a vision of a Free America, brick-by-brick,\" reads a statement within Women March’s call for action.\nAdvertisement\n“They want us scared, divided, and alone. They don’t want us to dream about freedom. But that’s exactly what we have to do,\" said the organization.\nAfter widespread “No Kings” protests took place throughout the U.S. on June 14, another round of demonstrations are set to take place on July 4.\n“No Kings 2.0” events have been scheduled in Wisconsin, Louisiana and Wyoming, along with at least ten other locations across the U.S. While the “No Kings” protests in June were notably rallying against “authoritarianism,” the event page for Wisconsin’s July 4 rally in Green Bay says that the focus this time is on ICE raids and activity amid Trump’s nationwide immigration crackdown.\nThe protest event page encourages those attending to stand up for “community, justice [in] solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.” In June, ICE arrests conducted in Trump’s second term reportedly reached over 100,000.\nAdvertisement\nOrganizers of “No Kings 2.0” events in Louisiana and Wyoming have stressed non-violent demonstrations as a core principle of the gatherings.\nRead More: Protesters Across the U.S. Rally Against Trump and Musk: ‘Stop Destroying America’\nLocals are planning a demonstration outside Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Protesters are scheduled to gather near the estate on the evening of July 4, equipped with a large balloon depicting the President as a baby.\nA similar balloon was hoisted above Trump’s Florida residence on Juneteenth in 2020, in protest against the treatment of Black Americans, in the weeks after the killing of George Floyd.\n\"We're supposed to be celebrating America's independence, and I felt a moral responsibility to stand up and declare our independence from Trump-ism,\" Mark Offerman, a local activist, told Palm Beach Daily News.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, The People’s Union USA is encouraging Americans to stay at home on July 4, boycotting large corporations and avoiding parades and firework displays in a show of solidarity against wealth inequality and ICE raids.\nInstead, The People’s Union USA, who organized the “Economic Blackout” in February, wants people to focus on supporting their communities and buying locally. Founder John Schwarz has called it the “most important boycott of the year.”\n“Do not wave a flag for a country that no longer waves it for you,” Schwarz said in a video. “The 4th of July is supposed to be a celebration of freedom, but what freedom are we actually talking about?”\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

    "content": "Reporter\nA banner showing a picture of President Donald Trump is displayed outside of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) building on June 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\nReporter\nThe 'Big, Beautiful Bill' is massively unpopular, Trump debates deporting Musk, July 4 protests, and more\nLength:\nLong\nSpeed:\n1.0x\nThis July 4, some Americans are planning to retire their Independence Day barbecues and instead head to the streets in protest against President Donald Trump and his Administration.\nThe collective demonstrations will be the latest in a long line of protests that have taken place since Trump returned to the White House for a second term. On June 14, as Trump held a national military parade in Washington, D.C.,–the largest the capital city has seen in decades—people across the U.S. gathered for counter-action, attending \"No Kings\" protests to publicly “reject authoritarianism.” Ahead of the big day, Trump had warned that “people that want to protest will be met with big force,” saying participants are “people that hate our country.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAmid the “No Kings” activism, states across the U.S. also encountered immigration protests as people demonstrated against the Trump Administration’s ICE raids. The protests notably started in Los Angeles and garnered national and international attention, especially after Trump deployed the National Guard, and later the Marines, to quell the demonstrations, without the request of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The decision resulted in much criticism and a legal battle, with an appeals court ultimately ruling that Trump was allowed to keep control of the National Guard in L.A.\nIn April, people gathered across the U.S. and international cities such as London, Paris, and Stockholm to protest against the actions of Trump and his then-ally, former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) lead Elon Musk. (The former allies have since had a very public falling out.)\nAdvertisement\nNow, a fresh round of protests are set to take place on July 4, America’s Independence Day. Here’s what we know about the planned action.\nWomen’s March, which coordinates protests across the U.S. against sexism and oppression, has published a list of over 140 events set to take place on July 4. The displays of protest range from rallies and marches to block parties. Women’s March has invited communities across the country to create even more events.\nPer the organization, the Free America Weekend aims to highlight key issues being faced by people across the U.S., such as poverty, unlawful orders, and “the grip of hate and the politics of fear.”\n\"This July 4th, while the U.S. marks Independence Day, we’ll gather across the country—on porches, in town squares, backyards, and streets—to stand for real freedom and build a vision of a Free America, brick-by-brick,\" reads a statement within Women March’s call for action.\nAdvertisement\n“They want us scared, divided, and alone.

    "title": " We ll Smash the Fucking Window Out and Drag Him O 20250804 052337",
    "content": "In Los Angeles, a terrified immigrant sits inside a truck as a masked man swings a baton, shattering his window.\nIn Baltimore, agents break a window and grab a man by the neck, pulling him out of his car.\nICE says its officers âuse only the level of force that is objectively reasonable.â Across America, whatâs âreasonableâ has changed.\nThis story contains videos and descriptions of violent arrests.\nA month into the new Trump administration, on the predawn streets of suburban Maryland, a high-ranking ICE official stood alongside a Mazda sedan that his officers had just stopped.\nThe official told a local TV reporter at the scene what was about to happen. âHe can either give us a license,â he said, âor weâll smash the fucking window out and drag him out.â Then, as the driver refused to exit the car, officers broke the glass.\nIt was one of nearly 50 documented instances of immigration agents breaking vehicle windows that ProPublica has identified from social media, local news accounts, lawsuits and interviews since President Donald Trump took office six months ago. Using the same methods, we found just eight in the previous decade. Neither number is comprehensive. The government releases no relevant statistics.\nUse-of-force experts and former Immigration and Customs Enforcement insiders say the tactic was rarely used during previous administrations. They say there is no known policy change greenlighting agentsâ smashing of windows. Rather, itâs a part of a broader shattering of norms.\nThere are arrest quotas, and they are increasingly aggressive. âThereâs been an emphasis placed on speed and numbers that did not exist before,â says Deborah Fleischaker, who served as ICE chief of staff under President Joe Biden.\nOfficers who break glass arenât being disciplined â theyâre being promoted. The official from Maryland, Matthew Elliston, now occupies a senior position at headquarters and oversees field operations on the East Coast. On the other side of the country, a Border Patrol chief who also embraced the tactic, Gregory Bovino, was put in charge of sweeps in Los Angeles. (Neither answered ProPublicaâs questions.)\nICE says its officers use a âminimum amount of forceâ when making arrests. You can judge for yourself.\nâShe is pregnant!â a man yelled as his wife, a U.S. citizen, filmed from inside their Chevy. âIs pregnant! Is pregnant!â\nOfficers smashed through three windows to arrest Jeison Ruiz Rodriguez and his younger brother CÃ©sar in early March. The video was not the first under Trump â at least nine broken-windows arrests preceded it this year, some documented by Facebook posts or local reporters or Spanish-language TV.\nOn Motherâs Day in the Boston suburbs, ICE and FBI officers stopped a family on their way to church, threatening Daniel Flores-Martinez with what the family and a bystander believe was a gun. His three children and U.S. citizen wife sobbed in the car. Agents broke the window, forced Martinez to his knees, then slammed him roughly to the ground.\nOne of the children is a toddler. Another is a 12-year old with severe disabilities.\nThe incident was captured by then-high school student Kenneth Santizo, who was nearby waiting for his bus. âAll I could hear was kids crying,â Santizo said.\nLast month, a bystander filmed several masked agents using a baton to break a rear window of a white pickup truck, taking the driver to the ground and pressing his head forcefully into the asphalt. The man, last seen in the video bleeding from the head, has not been identified.\nOn a residential street in May, agents smashed through two windows of a Ford Focus to arrest the two men inside. A neighbor filmed from inside their home as one man, later identified by WBUR as Guatemalan immigrant Kiender Lopez-Lopez, struggled with masked agents. (He had previously been charged with domestic violence but was not convicted.) Several of them tackled him on the sidewalk while he screamed for help. The government released no information about the arrest, despite repeated requests from WBUR and ProPublica.\nAt least 10 people have said they were injured this year during broken-windows arrests. CÃ©sar Ruiz Rodriguez had an open wound at the back of his head when he arrived at detention from Spokane, Washington, his lawyer said, and X-rays showed glass in the knees of his brother Jeison. ICE claimed that the Nicaraguan-born brothers were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Both men have denied any gang affiliation. We found that the brothers had been accused of threatening a family member, but prosecutors dropped the charges.\nIn Kentucky, agents stopped Martin Rivera and his girlfriend, Jennifer Gribben, a U.S. citizen, while the agents searched for a fugitive. âYou said youâre looking for Garcia,â Rivera said in a scene the couple broadcast on Facebook Live and have since deleted. One of the agents replied, âAnd I found you instead.â\nThen they smashed through the carâs window. Gribben later wrote on Facebook that she was beaten âbrutally in my headâ and that officers broke Riveraâs arm. She pleaded not guilty to charges of resisting arrest and third-degree assault stemming from the incident.\nNear Detroit, masked ICE officers dragged 49-year-old Veronica Ramirez Verduzco, an aide at an assisted-living center, out of her car through a window they broke. Ramirez Verduzco still had bloody, jagged scratches up and down her forearms five days later, her lawyer said.\nICE told ProPublica that agents are allowed to use force when civilians donât follow their commands. But Ramirez Verduzco and others said they were given little time to respond before officers broke their windows.\nâThey didnât give me a chance to understand what was going on,â she said in an interview shortly before she was ordered deported to Mexico.\nIn one case, ICE said a 51-year-old mom was connected to the MS-13 gang.\nThis spring, ICE arrested Elsy Noemi Berrios after breaking her car window, scattering glass over her patterned dress. Her teenage daughter screamed and cried as she filmed with her cellphone. An officer helped Berrios shake off the glass and step out of the car. âGracias,â she said. Then he put her in handcuffs.\nAfter the video went viral and outrage spread, the agency put out a statement asserting that Berrios, a Salvadoran national, was a âknown affiliate of the violent transnational street gang, MS-13.â Our review of judicial records â both federal and local â found no criminal history for Berrios and no other evidence to support this claim.\nThis July, in another widely circulated case, officers stopped an Iranian chiropractor and green-card applicant near Portland, Oregon. He was on his way to his toddlerâs preschool. âThere is a baby in the car,â the man said. They allowed him to continue to the school, then broke a window once the toddler was out. We found no criminal history for him.\nYour car is a constitutional gray zone. It doesnât have the same Fourth Amendment protections as homes. You can refuse to open the door of your home if officers donât have a judicial warrant; you canât refuse to step out of your car.\nThe Constitution still limits when officers can use force and how much they can use. But there are no firm rules. Should they shatter windows just minutes or seconds after making a vehicle stop? Should they drag someone through broken glass when they could wait to make the arrest another day?\nâUse of force has to be objectively reasonable,â says Bruce-Alan Barnard, a retired Fourth Amendment instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, where ICE officers train. The problem with âobjectively reasonable,â Barnard says, is that âitâs an oxymoron. Whatâs reasonable to you might not be reasonable to me.â\nImmigration officers are given little guidance on whether or how they should breach car windows, former federal law enforcement officials told ProPublica. The tactic was never prohibited. It was just rare.\nIt isnât mentioned in the governmentâs use-of-force guidelines for immigration agents. And past instructors and students at the Georgia training center say it was never part of the curriculum.\nIn Massachusetts this spring, a tall ICE officer in a truckerâs cap swung a sledgehammer to arrest Juan Francisco MÃ©ndez, the Guatemalan asylum-seeker inside. Officers had stopped the car looking for an âAntonio,â his wife told the New Bedford Light. MÃ©ndez has no known criminal record.\nHe and his wife told officers they were waiting to exit the car until their lawyer could arrive. Before the sledgehammer swung, one of the officers threatened them in broken Spanish: âWe can do it two ways. Hard or easy?â\nAn ICE spokesperson told ProPublica that the agency âconcurs with the actions deemed appropriate by the officers on the scene.â\nIn June, a 15-year-old girl and her mother watched as ICE agents stopped a work truck and roughly arrested several men.\nâFor the last time, are you opening this, or no?â an officer warned before he broke the glass. âIâm fucking blasting it right now.â\nWhile the teenager yelled and asked the officers if they had a warrant, the driver turned toward her camera and said he was a U.S. citizen.\nEarly this year, border czar Tom Homan made one of his now-familiar threats to a sanctuary jurisdiction, promising to bring âhellâ to the Boston area. To do that, his immigration officers needed help.\nAn ICE press release soon touted its collaboration with a half-dozen other federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and State Department, on a monthlong crackdown in the region, dubbed Operation Patriot. (The Coast Guard confirmed that it helped transport people arrested on Marthaâs Vineyard and Nantucket. The State Department also confirmed its role. Neither commented further.)\nIn May, bystanders filmed in nearby Waltham, Massachusetts, as masked agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations, along with agents from unidentified agencies, questioned two men parked in a work van. âShow me youâre here legally and Iâll leave you alone,â said one officer, identified on his vest only as âfederal agent.â\nIn the months since, federal officers from other agencies have continued to participate in immigration operations around the country.\nWhat happens if officers cross the line? Usually very little.\nPaths to suing federal officers are even more limited than for police officers, making it particularly hard for immigrants to hold officers accountable for any misconduct.\nâThe deck is stacked against them,â says Fleischaker, the former top ICE official.\nEven if a judge decides to award damages, that usually wonât change what happens â or already happened â in the separate system of immigration court. Evidence of a violent arrest rarely stops a deportation, and if people have already been deported, it wonât bring them back.\nIn the instance of the family detained on Motherâs Day, they filed a complaint over âunlawful and excessiveâ actions â but the father has already been deported to Mexico. (The government has not responded to the complaint or to ProPublicaâs questions about it.) A precursor to a full civil lawsuit, the complaint says their 3-year-old now tells people, âPolice broke the window and threw daddy on the floor.â\nSettlements in similar cases have been small. A California woman detained by Border Patrol in 2016 after agents broke her car window while her children screamed settled two years later for $25,000.\nWhen we asked the White House detailed questions about the tactic and specific incidents, it stood by officersâ conduct. âProPublica is a left-wing rag that is shamelessly doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,â deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said in a statement. âICE Officers are heroically getting these violent illegal aliens off of American streets with the utmost professionalism.â\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin also defended the tactic in response to questions about Border Patrol. Officers âmay break vehicle windowsâ if occupants donât follow their commands, she said. In June, an ICE spokesperson told ProPublica, âOur officers follow their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve situations in a manner that ensures the success of the operation and prioritizes safety.â\nOther agencies whose officers were involved in incidents we documented â FBI; DEA; and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives â did not respond or declined to comment on specific cases.\nBystanders who film these videos do so at no small risk to themselves.\nJob Garcia, a 37-year-old Ph.D. student and U.S. citizen, was filming an immigration raid in June near a Home Depot in Los Angeles when Border Patrol agents broke the window of a truck to detain the man inside. Then, agents turned on Garcia.\nThe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a complaint against the federal government on Garciaâs behalf in July, alleging agents detained him in retaliation for recording and because he was Latino.\nIn response to our questions, DHSâ McLaughlin claimed Garcia âassaulted and verbally harassedâ Border Patrol. (No assault is shown in the video.) McLaughlin added, âHe was subdued and arrested for assault on a federal agent.â\nKayden Goode, the 15-year-old girl who filmed the arrest of the U.S. citizen in Rochester, New York, said she felt compelled to record despite the risk.\n\"I donât think it was right,â Goode said. âJust because something is legal doesnât mean that itâs right.â\nSometimes just the threat of window smashing is enough. One Afghan asylum-seeker who stepped out of a car after ICE threatened his window said in an affidavit, âIt reminded me of the Taliban.â\nBut this all may be only the beginning. Shortly before Trumpâs flagship domestic policy bill passed in early July, border czar Tom Homan told a conservative Christian conference that immigration agencies were just getting started. The law will triple the size of ICE and add thousands more immigration agents.\nâYou think weâre arresting people now?â Homan said. âYou wait.â\nEarlier this year, reporter Nicole Foy heard about Border Patrol officers near Bakersfield, California, smashing a car window. Reporter McKenzie Funk also noticed immigration agents using the tactic in Washington state. The federal government does not publicly track how often agents break car windows, nor did government officials agree to requests to speak about it.\nIn the months that followed, Foy and Funk documented dozens of cases by searching social media, local news and legal filings. They spoke to current and former law enforcement officials, experts in constitutional law and advocates across the country and contacted the agencies of officers involved in the incidents.\nAlong with research reporter Mariam Elba, they also looked into the backgrounds of the identified individuals whose immigration arrests are shown in this story. They searched for records in the criminal courts of the counties in which the arrest took place, as well as in the counties public records show the person previously lived in. We found one criminal conviction among those people: Veronica Ramirez Verduzco was convicted of reentering the country illegally.\nThe findings on criminal records are not comprehensive because there is no universal database of charges or convictions, and there was not enough identifying information for some people. When the government made claims about an individual, Foy and Funk asked them for supporting evidence. They did not provide any.\nDo you have information or videos to share about the administrationâs immigration crackdown? Contact Nicole Foy via email at [email protected] or on Signal at nicolefoy.27 and McKenzie Funk via email at [email protected] or on Signal at 212-379-5757.\nDesign and development by Anna Donlan, visual editing by Shoshana Gordon, research by Mariam Elba and reporting by Rob Davis.

    "content": "In Los Angeles, a terrified immigrant sits inside a truck as a masked man swings a baton, shattering his window.\nIn Baltimore, agents break a window and grab a man by the neck, pulling him out of his car.\nICE says its officers âuse only the level of force that is objectively reasonable.â Across America, whatâs âreasonableâ has changed.\nThis story contains videos and descriptions of violent arrests.\nA month into the new Trump administration, on the predawn streets of suburban Maryland, a high-ranking ICE official stood alongside a Mazda sedan that his officers had just stopped.\nThe official told a local TV reporter at the scene what was about to happen. âHe can either give us a license,â he said, âor weâll smash the fucking window out and drag him out.â Then, as the driver refused to exit the car, officers broke the glass.\nIt was one of nearly 50 documented instances of immigration agents breaking vehicle windows that ProPublica has identified from social media, local news accounts, lawsuits and interviews since President Donald Trump took office six months ago. Using the same methods, we found just eight in the previous decade. Neither number is comprehensive. The government releases no relevant statistics.\nUse-of-force experts and former Immigration and Customs Enforcement insiders say the tactic was rarely used during previous administrations. They say there is no known policy change greenlighting agentsâ smashing of windows. Rather, itâs a part of a broader shattering of norms.\nThere are arrest quotas, and they are increasingly aggressive. âThereâs been an emphasis placed on speed and numbers that did not exist before,â says Deborah Fleischaker, who served as ICE chief of staff under President Joe Biden.\nOfficers who break glass arenât being disciplined â theyâre being promoted. The official from Maryland, Matthew Elliston, now occupies a senior position at headquarters and oversees field operations on the East Coast. On the other side of the country, a Border Patrol chief who also embraced the tactic, Gregory Bovino, was put in charge of sweeps in Los Angeles. (Neither answered ProPublicaâs questions.)\nICE says its officers use a âminimum amount of forceâ when making arrests. You can judge for yourself.\nâShe is pregnant!â a man yelled as his wife, a U.S. citizen, filmed from inside their Chevy. âIs pregnant! Is pregnant!â\nOfficers smashed through three windows to arrest Jeison Ruiz Rodriguez and his younger brother CÃ©sar in early March. The video was not the first under Trump â at least nine broken-windows arrests preceded it this year, some documented by Facebook posts or local reporters or Spanish-language TV.\nOn Motherâs Day in the Boston suburbs, ICE and FBI officers stopped a family on their way to church, threatening Daniel Flores-Martinez with what the family and a bystander believe was a gun.

The government released no information about the arrest, despite repeated requests from WBUR and ProPublica.\nAt least 10 people have said they were injured this year during broken-windows arrests. CÃ©sar Ruiz Rodriguez had an open wound at the back of his head when he arrived at detention from Spokane, Washington, his lawyer said, and X-rays showed glass in the knees of his brother Jeison. ICE claimed that the Nicaraguan-born brothers were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Both men have denied any gang affiliation. We found that the brothers had been accused of threatening a family member, but prosecutors dropped the charges.\nIn Kentucky, agents stopped Martin Rivera and his girlfriend, Jennifer Gribben, a U.S. citizen, while the agents searched for a fugitive. âYou said youâre looking for Garcia,â Rivera said in a scene the couple broadcast on Facebook Live and have since deleted. One of the agents replied, âAnd I found you instead.â\nThen they smashed through the carâs window. Gribben later wrote on Facebook that she was beaten âbrutally in my headâ and that officers broke Riveraâs arm. She pleaded not guilty to charges of resisting arrest and third-degree assault stemming from the incident.\nNear Detroit, masked ICE officers dragged 49-year-old Veronica Ramirez Verduzco, an aide at an assisted-living center, out of her car through a window they broke. Ramirez Verduzco still had bloody, jagged scratches up and down her forearms five days later, her lawyer said.\nICE told ProPublica that agents are allowed to use force when civilians donât follow their commands. But Ramirez Verduzco and others said they were given little time to respond before officers broke their windows.\nâThey didnât give me a chance to understand what was going on,â she said in an interview shortly before she was ordered deported to Mexico.\nIn one case, ICE said a 51-year-old mom was connected to the MS-13 gang.\nThis spring, ICE arrested Elsy Noemi Berrios after breaking her car window, scattering glass over her patterned dress. Her teenage daughter screamed and cried as she filmed with her cellphone. An officer helped Berrios shake off the glass and step out of the car. âGracias,â she said. Then he put her in handcuffs.\nAfter the video went viral and outrage spread, the agency put out a statement asserting that Berrios, a Salvadoran national, was a âknown affiliate of the violent transnational street gang, MS-13.â Our review of judicial records â both federal and local â found no criminal history for Berrios and no other evidence to support this claim.\nThis July, in another widely circulated case, officers stopped an Iranian chiropractor and green-card applicant near Portland, Oregon. He was on his way to his toddlerâs preschool. âThere is a baby in the car,â the man said. They allowed him to continue to the school, then broke a window once the toddler was out. We found no criminal history for him.\nYour car is a constitutional gray zone. It doesnât have the same Fourth Amendment protections as homes. You can refuse to open the door of your home if officers donât have a judicial warrant; you canât refuse to step out of your car.\nThe Constitution still limits when officers can use force and how much they can use. But there are no firm rules. Should they shatter windows just minutes or seconds after making a vehicle stop? Should they drag someone through broken glass when they could wait to make the arrest another day?\nâUse of force has to be objectively reasonable,â says Bruce-Alan Barnard, a retired Fourth Amendment instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, where ICE officers train. The problem with âobjectively reasonable,â Barnard says, is that âitâs an oxymoron. Whatâs reasonable to you might not be reasonable to me.â\nImmigration officers are given little guidance on whether or how they should breach car windows, former federal law enforcement officials told ProPublica. The tactic was never prohibited. It was just rare.\nIt isnât mentioned in the governmentâs use-of-force guidelines for immigration agents. And past instructors and students at the Georgia training center say it was never part of the curriculum.\nIn Massachusetts this spring, a tall ICE officer in a truckerâs cap swung a sledgehammer to arrest Juan Francisco MÃ©ndez, the Guatemalan asylum-seeker inside. Officers had stopped the car looking for an âAntonio,â his wife told the New Bedford Light. MÃ©ndez has no known criminal record.\nHe and his wife told officers they were waiting to exit the car until their lawyer could arrive. Before the sledgehammer swung, one of the officers threatened them in broken Spanish: âWe can do it two ways. Hard or easy?â\nAn ICE spokesperson told ProPublica that the agency âconcurs with the actions deemed appropriate by the officers on the scene.â\nIn June, a 15-year-old girl and her mother watched as ICE agents stopped a work truck and roughly arrested several men.\nâFor the last time, are you opening this, or no?â an officer warned before he broke the glass. âIâm fucking blasting it right now.â\nWhile the teenager yelled and asked the officers if they had a warrant, the driver turned toward her camera and said he was a U.S. citizen.\nEarly this year, border czar Tom Homan made one of his now-familiar threats to a sanctuary jurisdiction, promising to bring âhellâ to the Boston area. To do that, his immigration officers needed help.\nAn ICE press release soon touted its collaboration with a half-dozen other federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and State Department, on a monthlong crackdown in the region, dubbed Operation Patriot. (The Coast Guard confirmed that it helped transport people arrested on Marthaâs Vineyard and Nantucket. The State Department also confirmed its role. Neither commented further.)\nIn May, bystanders filmed in nearby Waltham, Massachusetts, as masked agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations, along with agents from unidentified agencies, questioned two men parked in a work van. âShow me youâre here legally and Iâll leave you alone,â said one officer, identified on his vest only as âfederal agent.â\nIn the months since, federal officers from other agencies have continued to participate in immigration operations around the country.\nWhat happens if officers cross the line? Usually very little.\nPaths to suing federal officers are even more limited than for police officers, making it particularly hard for immigrants to hold officers accountable for any misconduct.\nâThe deck is stacked against them,â says Fleischaker, the former top ICE official.\nEven if a judge decides to award damages, that usually wonât change what happens â or already happened â in the separate system of immigration court. Evidence of a violent arrest rarely stops a deportation, and if people have already been deported, it wonât bring them back.\nIn the instance of the family detained on Motherâs Day, they filed a complaint over âunlawful and excessiveâ actions â but the father has already been deported to Mexico. (The government has not responded to the complaint or to ProPublicaâs questions about it.) A precursor to a full civil lawsuit, the complaint says their 3-year-old now tells people, âPolice broke the window and threw daddy on the floor.â\nSettlements in similar cases have been small. A California woman detained by Border Patrol in 2016 after agents broke her car window while her children screamed settled two years later for $25,000.\nWhen we asked the White House detailed questions about the tactic and specific incidents, it stood by officersâ conduct. âProPublica is a left-wing rag that is shamelessly doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,â deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said in a statement. âICE Officers are heroically getting these violent illegal aliens off of American streets with the utmost professionalism.â\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin also defended the tactic in response to questions about Border Patrol. Officers âmay break vehicle windowsâ if occupants donât follow their commands, she said. In June, an ICE spokesperson told ProPublica, âOur officers follow their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve situations in a manner that ensures the success of the operation and prioritizes safety.â\nOther agencies whose officers were involved in incidents we documented â FBI; DEA; and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives â did not respond or declined to comment on specific cases.\nBystanders who film these videos do so at no small risk to themselves.\nJob Garcia, a 37-year-old Ph.D. student and U.S. citizen, was filming an immigration raid in June near a Home Depot in Los Angeles when Border Patrol agents broke the window of a truck to detain the man inside. Then, agents turned on Garcia.\nThe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a complaint against the federal government on Garciaâs behalf in July, alleging agents detained him in retaliation for recording and because he was Latino.\nIn response to our questions, DHSâ McLaughlin claimed Garcia âassaulted and verbally harassedâ Border Patrol. (No assault is shown in the video.) McLaughlin added, âHe was subdued and arrested for assault on a federal agent.â\nKayden Goode, the 15-year-old girl who filmed the arrest of the U.S. citizen in Rochester, New York, said she felt compelled to record despite the risk.\n\"I donât think it was right,â Goode said. âJust because something is legal doesnât mean that itâs right.â\nSometimes just the threat of window smashing is enough. One Afghan asylum-seeker who stepped out of a car after ICE threatened his window said in an affidavit, âIt reminded me of the Taliban.â\nBut this all may be only the beginning. Shortly before Trumpâs flagship domestic policy bill passed in early July, border czar Tom Homan told a conservative Christian conference that immigration agencies were just getting started. The law will triple the size of ICE and add thousands more immigration agents.\nâYou think weâre arresting people now?â Homan said. âYou wait.â\nEarlier this year, reporter Nicole Foy heard about Border Patrol officers near Bakersfield, California, smashing a car window. Reporter McKenzie Funk also noticed immigration agents using the tactic in Washington state. The federal government does not publicly track how often agents break car windows, nor did government officials agree to requests to speak about it.\nIn the months that followed, Foy and Funk documented dozens of cases by searching social media, local news and legal filings. They spoke to current and former law enforcement officials, experts in constitutional law and advocates across the country and contacted the agencies of officers involved in the incidents.\nAlong with research reporter Mariam Elba, they also looked into the backgrounds of the identified individuals whose immigration arrests are shown in this story. They searched for records in the criminal courts of the counties in which the arrest took place, as well as in the counties public records show the person previously lived in. We found one criminal conviction among those people: Veronica Ramirez Verduzco was convicted of reentering the country illegally.\nThe findings on criminal records are not comprehensive because there is no universal database of charges or convictions, and there was not enough identifying information for some people. When the government made claims about an individual, Foy and Funk asked them for supporting evidence. They did not provide any.\nDo you have information or videos to share about the administrationâs immigration crackdown?

    "content": "For Newton it may have been 'that' apple, but for our own Dr climate the heat was on at the Big Apple - when he took part in the 2007 New York 100K skate marathon...::: Finding myself in the US while my skate mates were doing marathons across Europe, I came down with a severe case of marathon-envy.  The solution to this soon became obvious when I discovered that I would be in New York city the same weekend as the NYC skate marathon and New York 100k.   The 100k race offered the chance to pack two and a half marathons into one and thus seemed the value for time and money event.Let's quickly get the usual disclaimers over and note that I had not trained for a 100k race, nor had I spent much time on skates this year.Since I was on holidays and enjoying the moments, I could happily forget about all preparation for the race until race eve.  I stayed with mates in Brooklyn who just happened to live two blocks from Prospect Park, where the race takes place. That meant I could skate to the start and try out the new blister-protector sock inserts that Yaki put me on to.  They seemed okay.The circuit in Prospect Park is excellent.  The surface is smooth and wide.  The inner lanes are given over to the normal park rec users and the races use the outer lanes.  From the perspective of a Melbourne flatland skater, the course has one major uphill, a few undulations, and one major downhill section.  The 100k race runs simultaneously with marathon and half marathon races around the 5k circuit.  On a sunny autumn day, such as we had, the atmosphere in the park is carnival-like, with a stream of bikers and runners as well as the few hundred skate racers.The 100k start offered the thrill of skating off with the main pack until the first hill kicked in.  That immediately separated the elite skaters from the rest of us.   By the top of the hill I found myself in a 'train' of about eight skaters.  We stuck together for about the first 20k before I got dropped.  The rest of the race was a more solitary affair for me, apart from a few laps with Olivier and a couple with a Vermont club skater. The downhill sections were also a bit of a thrill for me.  Our train accelerated at the crest of the down, tucked into a single long formation, hand to hip, and then just seemed to accelerate without limit.  As a flatland skater, I don't think I've ever been so fast on skates.The uphill was another matter.  My Vermont companion described it as a love/hate thing, but he lied; there was nothing to love about it.  With each passing lap it grinds more of the life out of you.My only relief was the fact that the blister protectors were killing my feet and I had to stop and take my skates off and rip them off.  That gave me a five minute rest in the middle of the race. (not my ankles in the pic, but you get the idea)Since I forgot to bring any food, my only option was the bananas handed out at the food and drink station.  Bananas are great, but I consumed eight of them over the course of the race and haven't wanted to look at another one since.  One of the food drop guys was taunting me with another banana offer as I skated off home after the race, so my banana consumption must have stood out.My pacing over the distance was woeful.  I skated the first 42k in about the same time as I would usually skate a marathon, and died in the tail thereafter.  For next time, better pacing and a bit of endurance training are needed.  My recovery wasn't textbook either.  I skated back to the mate's place, had a shower, threw my things together, caught a taxi to the airport, then sat on a plane with my legs immobile for the next 24 hours.All in all, it's a great race though and I'll do it again as soon as I forget those pledges I made to myself during the last 50km not to do this race again.James\nPost a Comment\nNewer Post\n\n\nOlder Post\n\nHome\nSubscribe in a reader",

    "title": "   Totalement français 20250804 060504",
    "content": "Here is an a excerpt of a longer post I originally sent to the Eu07 tour blog- typed on a crazy French keyboard with as many typos as a non qwerty layout will allow in a short time.  The story covers some of our skating in France. It proved popular enough to be considered as a stand alone piece, with some pictures added...::: For those who have never experience this- the Paris Friday night skate is a weekly event with between 5000- 8000 skaters! doing a 30 KM tour of Paris- starting at 10PM and concluding just after 1 AM at Montparnase metro. We arrived on time and after listening carefully to he instructions for that nights 'course du skate' (the route changes every week) which were in French and which we understood totally (NOT) we asked one of the crew and he told us this will be a new course which was never tried before- a climb to Montmartre and a super downhill- cobblestones and all- yeah great...Montmartre is certainly one of the more elevated spot of Paris, mmm, so off we went just after 10.15 escorted by police on skates, 2 ambulances, and about 50 crew from the organization.I cannot find words to describe the incredible sight of 8000 skaters flying at a good pace thru the streets of Paris- the police stopped the traffic at intersections and we all came flying past, traffic and crowds at a standstill, many people cheering, and the skaters moving like a giant snake thru the many districts of Paris. Skaters were of mixed ability, and aside from the cobblestones and hills, the challenge was mainly not to get tripped by other skaters in the huge crowd. Than we came to the big downhill...and big it was indeed! for close to 10 minutes we just flew downhill, at something like 47 Kmh, with lots of people crashing, including 2 support crews and the medical staff, and we had to dodge quite a few people, stay on course AND manage to Stop at intersections as instructed.... wow, this took some years of all of us, and the only stopping style was the good old T stop.Raph managed to slide on a plastic bottle and got a more intimate contact with the Parisian pavement, but was patched up soon by the crew, and off we went into the night.Incredible is the only way to describe the sensation, and despite the fact that we spent 3 hours going up and down the hills of Paris, when we got to the finish everyone was feeling a great sense of exhilaration.We arrived just after 1 Am, too late for the last metro, and so proceeded ( like many others) to the nearest pub for a post skate drink (OK, a few) and then, in what proved to be the biggest challenge of the evening- try and get a taxi back to our hotels. Everyone in Paris appeared to had the same idea just than, but we eventually managed to get a cab to our hotel, making it just on 3 AM- a long day's journey into night. After a late start Saturday, a leisurely breakfast and a tour of the town (and a skate shop) we arrange the transport for the St Cheron marathon the next day.On to St CheronA train journey of about an hour got us to St Cheron, a pretty rural village south of Paris, where the 3 valleys race was being held. We arrived prepared this time- with safety pins ( to insure no repeat of 'the Italian experience')- alas pins were in great supply, and so we had time for a first good look at the course.The 3 valleys race was indeed going to be an up and down event- something we are not quite used to in Melbourne. We also realized that the surfaces we train and use are in fact far better than what most people are used to in Europe ( the Cesenatico race being an extreme example, but a true one nevertheless) and as we were told, this race was going thru a number of villages and we could expect a variety of road types, including cobblestones, sharp corners, and lots of climbs and long down hills.Registration and preliminary announcements over, The event started with a fast down hill roll thru town- Le Parade- with much waving a and cheering by the locals, and then a nice roll/ grunt uphill thru the magnificent centre of Saint Cheron to what we understood to be the location of the start line.We were told that the group of Nordic skaters- on long skates and poles, were to be sent off first, to be followed a minute or so later by the rest of us. This seemed simple enough, but as we headed uphill it appeared a last minute change of plan took place, and unbeknown to us the race started without warning or order, and it took us a minute or two to catch on and get going.Once at the top of the hill, the route left St Cheron in a long fast downhill and into the countryside, gaining speed and encountering deteriorating surface, but the going was steady, and the landscape magnificent.Soon we arrived at the next village and the start of some spectacular sharp turns over cobblestones, without having the slightest clue what was around the corner.... The event controllers were shouting instructions ( I think) but the level of my French- especially attempting to comprehend garbled word at fast speed with incredible vibrations through my skates and whole body while shitting myself somewhat (try high speed cobblestone turn and find out for yourself) prevented me from understanding anything but the realization that survival mode was 'de rigure du jour'.This is not to say in any way that this was not fantastic fun, just that those corners seemed to be always the start of another downhill through some narrow village lanes- until we got out of the pretty town and into the countryside once more, and a good run out and a bit of level terrain. All of us managed to stay on our skates, with my GPS showing speeds of 45Kmh plus through the route, and the holes in the road appearing more frequent, and bigger. I noticed that some of the locals employed another cornering technique, especially in one very steep downhill, they simply avoided the corner by flying straight into the forest for a bit of tree hugging, then back with a new shrubbery on top of the skin suits- I hope the bushes were softer than they appeared.The uphills were less difficult than i suspected, although while coming up the valley and looking up at skaters already on the ridge was somewhat demoralizing, but we kept a good pace. At one stage a group of 3 Frenchmen got behind me an literally hung on to me while we skated in a fantastic open valley- telling me 'Technique Australic' was magnific- yeah right- I was just trying to stay upright and keep the pace ( thanks DG & Bas).In the next downhill I seemed to have lost my French new friends, and joined another skater in a super tuck downhill, something between Olympic giant slalom posture and total out of control reality, but once again, with more luck than skill, somehow made it to the next uphill, and, suddenly, a 2 km sign to the finish- all uphill of course.Before I realized, I could hear the shouts of the guys at the finish line- which seemed a long way off- especially the last 100 meters of moderate uphill, and then we were there- happy, and in good shape. Raph arrived a few minutes earlier, and Inna and Eva a while after me- all in good shape and great spirits- it was a really enjoyable event in a fantastic landscape- just what I imagined back in Oz when i read about the race.The other competitors, almost all French, were very friendly and supportive, and were excited about us making it all the way from Australia to this race. We stayed for the presentation of the trophies and words from the mayor, and were told officials results will be posted soon.It was great fun! and you can see this also in the following SMS Raph sent home:\"3 valleys today at st Cheron (www.rm3v.com) about 1 hour from Paris was brilliant.It was a tough steep and tight course through beautiful French countryside forests and villages. A lot of altitude changes ~150m! surface varied from AAA to horrid!.

    "content": "Here is an a excerpt of a longer post I originally sent to the Eu07 tour blog- typed on a crazy French keyboard with as many typos as a non qwerty layout will allow in a short time.  The story covers some of our skating in France. It proved popular enough to be considered as a stand alone piece, with some pictures added...::: For those who have never experience this- the Paris Friday night skate is a weekly event with between 5000- 8000 skaters! doing a 30 KM tour of Paris- starting at 10PM and concluding just after 1 AM at Montparnase metro. We arrived on time and after listening carefully to he instructions for that nights 'course du skate' (the route changes every week) which were in French and which we understood totally (NOT) we asked one of the crew and he told us this will be a new course which was never tried before- a climb to Montmartre and a super downhill- cobblestones and all- yeah great...Montmartre is certainly one of the more elevated spot of Paris, mmm, so off we went just after 10.15 escorted by police on skates, 2 ambulances, and about 50 crew from the organization.I cannot find words to describe the incredible sight of 8000 skaters flying at a good pace thru the streets of Paris- the police stopped the traffic at intersections and we all came flying past, traffic and crowds at a standstill, many people cheering, and the skaters moving like a giant snake thru the many districts of Paris. Skaters were of mixed ability, and aside from the cobblestones and hills, the challenge was mainly not to get tripped by other skaters in the huge crowd. Than we came to the big downhill...and big it was indeed! for close to 10 minutes we just flew downhill, at something like 47 Kmh, with lots of people crashing, including 2 support crews and the medical staff, and we had to dodge quite a few people, stay on course AND manage to Stop at intersections as instructed.... wow, this took some years of all of us, and the only stopping style was the good old T stop.Raph managed to slide on a plastic bottle and got a more intimate contact with the Parisian pavement, but was patched up soon by the crew, and off we went into the night.Incredible is the only way to describe the sensation, and despite the fact that we spent 3 hours going up and down the hills of Paris, when we got to the finish everyone was feeling a great sense of exhilaration.We arrived just after 1 Am, too late for the last metro, and so proceeded ( like many others) to the nearest pub for a post skate drink (OK, a few) and then, in what proved to be the biggest challenge of the evening- try and get a taxi back to our hotels. Everyone in Paris appeared to had the same idea just than, but we eventually managed to get a cab to our hotel, making it just on 3 AM- a long day's journey into night. After a late start Saturday, a leisurely breakfast and a tour of the town (and a skate shop) we arrange the transport for the St Cheron marathon the next day.On to St CheronA train journey of about an hour got us to St Cheron, a pretty rural village south of Paris, where the 3 valleys race was being held. We arrived prepared this time- with safety pins ( to insure no repeat of 'the Italian experience')- alas pins were in great supply, and so we had time for a first good look at the course.The 3 valleys race was indeed going to be an up and down event- something we are not quite used to in Melbourne. We also realized that the surfaces we train and use are in fact far better than what most people are used to in Europe ( the Cesenatico race being an extreme example, but a true one nevertheless) and as we were told, this race was going thru a number of villages and we could expect a variety of road types, including cobblestones, sharp corners, and lots of climbs and long down hills.Registration and preliminary announcements over, The event started with a fast down hill roll thru town- Le Parade- with much waving a and cheering by the locals, and then a nice roll/ grunt uphill thru the magnificent centre of Saint Cheron to what we understood to be the location of the start line.We were told that the group of Nordic skaters- on long skates and poles, were to be sent off first, to be followed a minute or so later by the rest of us. This seemed simple enough, but as we headed uphill it appeared a last minute change of plan took place, and unbeknown to us the race started without warning or order, and it took us a minute or two to catch on and get going.Once at the top of the hill, the route left St Cheron in a long fast downhill and into the countryside, gaining speed and encountering deteriorating surface, but the going was steady, and the landscape magnificent.Soon we arrived at the next village and the start of some spectacular sharp turns over cobblestones, without having the slightest clue what was around the corner.... The event controllers were shouting instructions ( I think) but the level of my French- especially attempting to comprehend garbled word at fast speed with incredible vibrations through my skates and whole body while shitting myself somewhat (try high speed cobblestone turn and find out for yourself) prevented me from understanding anything but the realization that survival mode was 'de rigure du jour'.This is not to say in any way that this was not fantastic fun, just that those corners seemed to be always the start of another downhill through some narrow village lanes- until we got out of the pretty town and into the countryside once more, and a good run out and a bit of level terrain. All of us managed to stay on our skates, with my GPS showing speeds of 45Kmh plus through the route, and the holes in the road appearing more frequent, and bigger. I noticed that some of the locals employed another cornering technique, especially in one very steep downhill, they simply avoided the corner by flying straight into the forest for a bit of tree hugging, then back with a new shrubbery on top of the skin suits- I hope the bushes were softer than they appeared.The uphills were less difficult than i suspected, although while coming up the valley and looking up at skaters already on the ridge was somewhat demoralizing, but we kept a good pace. At one stage a group of 3 Frenchmen got behind me an literally hung on to me while we skated in a fantastic open valley- telling me 'Technique Australic' was magnific- yeah right- I was just trying to stay upright and keep the pace ( thanks DG & Bas).In the next downhill I seemed to have lost my French new friends, and joined another skater in a super tuck downhill, something between Olympic giant slalom posture and total out of control reality, but once again, with more luck than skill, somehow made it to the next uphill, and, suddenly, a 2 km sign to the finish- all uphill of course.Before I realized, I could hear the shouts of the guys at the finish line- which seemed a long way off- especially the last 100 meters of moderate uphill, and then we were there- happy, and in good shape. Raph arrived a few minutes earlier, and Inna and Eva a while after me- all in good shape and great spirits- it was a really enjoyable event in a fantastic landscape- just what I imagined back in Oz when i read about the race.The other competitors, almost all French, were very friendly and supportive, and were excited about us making it all the way from Australia to this race. We stayed for the presentation of the trophies and words from the mayor, and were told officials results will be posted soon.It was great fun! and you can see this also in the following SMS Raph sent home:\"3 valleys today at st Cheron (www.rm3v.com) about 1 hour from Paris was brilliant.It was a tough steep and tight course through beautiful French countryside forests and villages. A lot of altitude changes ~150m! surface varied from AAA to horrid!. Course was 30km downhill sections were fast like the city to surf! and  uphill sections were gut-renching locals were fantastic cheering us along the way through cobblestone walled provincial french villages with tight fast corners a real roadrace and very exciting!

    "content": "Contributor\nدود از زندان اوین در شمال تهران، ایران، در پی حمله هوایی اسرائیل در ۲۳ ژوئن ۲۰۲۵ بلند می‌شود\nContributor\nRead this story in English here\nنمازی گروگان سابق آمریکایی در ایران است و اکنون عضو هیئت مشاوران ابتکار آزادی برای زندانیان سیاسی در مؤسسه مک‌کین و گروه کمک جهانی به گروگان‌ها است.\nوقتی تصاویر دروازه‌ی ورودی زندان اوین را دیدم که با حمله‌ی هوایی اسرائیل تکه تکه شده بود، چشمانم پر از اشک شد. من هشت سال پشت آن دروازه به‌عنوان گروگان جمهوری اسلامی نگهداری شدم — در مکانی که ظلم، قانون است و امید قاچاق می‌شود.\nاما اشک‌هایم از خوشحالی نبود. از این‌که کسانی که من و بعدتر پدر بیمارم را به سلول انفرادی انداختند بالاخره تاوانی پس داده‌اند، لذتی نمی‌بردم. قبلم پر از اندوه بود وقتی به وحشتی فکر می‌کردم که اکنون بسیاری از زندانیان بی‌گناه — از جمله کسانی که سال‌ها هم‌سلولی‌ام بودند — و خانواده‌هایشان تجربه می‌کنند.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nاین فقط یک حمله به نماد سرکوب نبود. اسرائیل تنها درِ زندان را منفجر نکرد. بمب‌هایش، در ساعات کاری، مجتمع قضایی شهید مقدس را نیز به شدت تخریب کرد. جایی که زندانیان را پیش بازپرسان بی‌رحم می‌برند و وارد ماشین سرکوب دادگاه انقلاب می‌کنند. من در آن اتاق‌ها بوده‌ام، دست‌بند خورده و تحقیر شده، مقابل مردانی که خود را قاضی می‌نامیدند اما مانند زیردستان مأموران اطلاعات رفتار می‌کردند و هر حکمی که آنها می‌دادند را امضا می‌کردند. یکی‌شان را در خفا \"جنایت‌کار\" صدا می‌زدم، لقبی که بازی با نامش بود و بین ما ماندگار شد. یادم هست وقتی در بی‌خبری کامل و قطع از دنیای بیرون به سر می‌بردم با پوزخندی گفت: «مادرت طبقه‌ی پایین منتظره. هر روز میاد و التماس می‌کنه برای ملاقات»؛ پوزخندی که دلم می‌خواست با سیلی از صورتش پاک کنم.\nاما آن مرکز بی‌عدالتی فقط پر از جلاد نبود. بمب‌ها بین بازپرسان ظالم و زندانیان سیاسی، و یا سربازان وظیفه ۱۸ تا ۲۰ ساله که صرفاً مأمور همراهی زندانیان هستند فرق نمی‌گذارند. آیا وکلای حقوق بشری که با شجاعت از بی‌دفاع‌ها دفاع می‌کردند هم در میان قربانیان بودند؟ چند نفر از نظافت‌چی‌ها و کارمندان اداری که از حومه‌ی دور و فقیر تهران برای کار می‌آمدند حالا کشته یا مجروح شده‌اند؟ خانواده‌هایی که در سالن انتظار بودند، مثل زمانی که مادرم هر روز می‌آمد تا درخواست ملاقات یا دارو کند، چه سرنوشتی پیدا کردند؟\nAdvertisement\nبمب‌های اسرائیل درمانگاه زندان را هم زدند؛ جایی که من و بسیاری دیگر بارها برای ویزیت به صف می‌شدیم. جائی که پر از ناامیدی بود، اما شجاعت‌های پنهانی هم وجود داشت. بر سر آن دکتر زن جوان که من «قهرمان» خطابش می‌کردم چه آمد؟ او یک بار در دوران کرونا با شجاعت وارد بند زنان شد مسئولان زندان را مجبور کرد که یک زندانی سیاسی را که وضعیت وخیم کرونایی داشت، به بیمارستان منتقل کنند. او جان آن زن را نجات داد. کارکنان درمانگاه بارها به ما کمک کردند — کمک‌هایی که نمی‌توانم علنی بگویم. مهربانی‌های بی‌منت و بی‌پاداش‌شان به ما امید ادامه زندگی می‌داد. حالا آن درمانگاه ویران شده است.\nبند ۴، که محل نگهداری بسیاری از زندانیان سیاسی و گروگان‌های دوتابعیتی یا خارجی است، نیز آسیب دیده. از جمله کتابخانه، تنها پناهگاه ما، جایی که من بیشتر روزها را آن‌جا می‌گذراندم. بند زنان هم آسیب دیده. بلافاصله بعد از حمله، زندانیان سیاسی زن و مرد را ناگهانی سوار اتوبوس کرده‌اند و بدون وسایل شخصی‌شان به مکانی نامعلوم منتقل کرده‌اند. خانواده‌های وحشت‌زده اکنون مستاصل با یکدیگر تماس می‌گیرند، دنبال خبری از عزیزانشان هستند، دعا می‌کنند که زنده باشند و نظام سعی نکند از آن‌ها انتقام حمله اسرائیلی‌ها را بگیرد‌.\nAdvertisement\nزندان اوین شامل چندین بازداشتگاه است. بدترین‌شان زیر نظر وزارت اطلاعات و سپاه پاسداران قرار دارد. بنا به خبرهای رسید، آن‌ها نیز آسیب دیده‌اند. من بیش از دو سال در یکی از همان بازداشتگاه‌ها بودم. نمی‌دانیم آیا بازجوهایی که من را کتک می‌زدند آسیب دیده‌اند یا نه، همان‌طور که نمی‌دانیم آیا زندانیان سیاسی زیر آوار سلول‌های انفرادی و اتاق‌های شکنجه مدفون شده‌اند یا نه.\nمرکز ملاقات زندان هم آسیب دیده. چند زندانی، خانواده یا وکیل در آن‌جا کشته یا مجروح شده‌اند؟ آن ناظر مهربانی که اجازه می‌داد مادرم بیشتر بماند و محدودیت ۲۰ دقیقه‌ای ملاقات‌ها را نادیده می‌گرفت و می‌گفت: «این تنها کمکیه که می‌تونم به خانواده شما که انقدر ظلم دیده بکنم»، چه سرنوشتی یافت؟\nاین یک حمله‌ی هدفمند به فرماندهان نظامی یا مقامات عالی‌رتبه رژیم نبود. این بمب‌ها مردم ایران را تشویق نمی‌کند تا علیه جمهوری اسلامی برخیزند. برعکس. یکی از زندانیان سابق می‌گوید خانواده‌های زندانیان، نگهبانان و کارکنان آن بیرون زندان جمع شده‌اند تا بلکه خبری از عزیزشان بشنوند و در کنار هم در حال اشک ریختن هستند.\nAdvertisement\nبمباران اوین نشان می‌دهد وقتی دو نظام  غیراخلاقیبا هم برخورد می‌کنند، چه اتفاقی می‌افتد: یکی بی‌گناهان را زندانی می‌کند، و دیگری با بمب‌بارانشان مدعی آزادی آن‌ها است. تنها امید ما این است که آتش‌بس شکننده میان ایران، اسرائیل و آمریکا پابرجا بماند و این دیوانگی پایان یابد.\nاما حتی اگر چنین شود، همه می‌دانیم بعدش چه خواهد شد. آیت‌الله‌ها که نتوانسته‌اند جلوی بمب‌ها را بگیرند، خشم خود را به داخل نشانه خواهند گرفت. آن‌ها سعی خواهند کرد با خشونت قدرت خود را بازگردانند. هزاران نفر دستگیر، شکنجه و اعدام خواهند شد تا رژیم با ایجاد ترس زنده بماند. جوامع آسیب‌پذیرتر — مانند بهائیان — احتمالاً جزو نخستین قربانیان خواهند بود.\nهمان‌طور که همیشه بوده، بی‌گناهان بیشترین تاوان را خواهند داد.\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

    "content": "Profile\nSections\nLocal\ntv\nFeatured\nMore From NBC\nFollow NBC News\nnews Alerts\nThere are no new alerts at this time\nHONG KONG — A 12-year-old Chinese swimmer has become a global sensation with her history-making times, even as observers and fans back home caution against overhyping the young athlete.\nOn Thursday, Yu Zidi became the youngest-ever medalist at the World Aquatics Championships, which are being held in Singapore this year. On Sunday, she finished fourth in the women's 400 individual medley final.\nYu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women’s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.\n“I was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,” Yu told reporters Thursday. “The World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.”\nThe Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.\n“At the time, I thought: why not give training a try?” Yu told Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, in May.\nYu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, swims so fast that she qualified for the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.\nShe came close to medaling in three other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women’s 200-meter medley Monday, 0.31 seconds in the women’s 200-meter butterfly Thursday and 0.50 seconds in the women’s 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.\nAt the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.\nHailed as the world’s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Canada’s Summer McIntosh, who won four golds in Singapore including the 400-meter medley. Though Yu came in fourth, she is already swimming that event about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.\nHer stunning performance before she’s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.\nBut some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.\nYu’s sudden fame may expose her to “disproportionate” pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.\n“We must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,” it said, adding that there is “no need to rush into hero worship.”\nThe warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a “toxic” fan culture.\nSuccess at the highest levels of sport has been central to China’s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.\nBut the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries’ star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.\nOrganized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.\nThe new fans brought “sophisticated strategies” from the entertainment industry, setting off “fandom wars” among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.\nChina’s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.\nWhen gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.\nPan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.\nThe Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.\nBut sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.\n“I never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,” he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him “severe” mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.\nSince sports prodigies naturally attract followers, fan groups could also be a concern for Yu in the future, said Zhang, who was at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.\nChina is often overprotective of its athletes, but it “may not be a good thing if Yu is living in isolation like protected giant pandas,” he said.\n“For athletes, learning to interact with the media is a necessary part of their development,” Zhang added.\nJessie Zhou, 23, a graduate student in Hong Kong who closely follows table tennis star Fan, said it was a “good call” for Chinese media to cover Yu in a “restrained tone” while extreme sports fandom remains unresolved.\n“Just let the kid stay focused on training,” Zhou said.\nPeter Guo is a fellow on NBC’s Asia Desk, based in Hong Kong.\nEve Qiao is an intern on NBC News's Asia Desk.\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

    "content": "Singapore\nSingapore\nLisa wanted to borrow S$30,000 from a moneylender. She ended up being harassed by loansharks and investigated by police, all while never getting a single cent.\nSingapore dollar notes. (File Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)\nSINGAPORE: A few months were all it took for Lisa (not her real name), 21, to spiral from being a victim of scam to a perpetrator of crime.\nShe started with legitimate intentions to get a S$30,000 loan from a licensed moneylender, but ended up losing even more cash in a loan scam while getting viciously harassed by loansharks.\nTo top it off, Lisa was threatened into giving up her ATM card, and her account was used to transfer illicit funds. She was eventually given a conditional warning by the police for being a money mule.\nLatest figures released by the police in August showed another increase in scams - 85 per cent up in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year - driving up the total reported cases of crime.\nThe Government also announced in March that it intends to make it easier for money laundering offences to be prosecuted at lower levels of culpability, by amending the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, likely in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\"Today, a large proportion of investigations into money mules do not result in prosecutions, due to the inherent difficulties in proving the money mule’s intent to participate in moving monies for scam syndicates,\" Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan had said.\nWhen asked how it felt like being both a victim and accused, Lisa told reporters on Thursday (Aug 25) that she feels “bad”. “But at the same time, I’m still scared because they did harass my family,” she said.\nLisa’s desire to care for her family was how she got into this situation in the first place.\nIn December 2020, she was barely earning S$2,000 a month as an auxiliary security officer when she gave birth to a boy.\nHer jobless husband used her money for his personal expenses, she said, adding that he quickly grew tired of caring for the baby.\nLisa, who also has a daughter - then 5 years old - living in Malaysia with an uncle, decided to go back to work during her confinement period.\n“He was not helping in anything ... I needed to support my family and pay the outstanding bills,” she said. “And if I had enough money, I would go back to study. Because Singapore is all about (having) the certificate.”\nLisa said her thoughts went “haywire” as she went on the Internet to search for moneylenders.\nShe found a company with a name and website that looked legitimate enough, so she clicked on an icon to get in touch via WhatsApp.\nThis was the beginning of Lisa’s months-long nightmare that revolved around persistent demands for money as well as threats to her family, before culminating in her being investigated as a money laundering suspect.\nThe moneylender asked Lisa, a Singapore permanent resident, for her personal details before releasing the loan. So, she sent pictures of her payslips as well as her Singapore and Malaysia identity cards.\nThe first red flag was when the moneylender asked her to pay an administrative fee amounting to 10 per cent of the loan.\n“They told me this after I gave my details,” she said. “I was having doubts. Why do I need to pay when I never received what I wanted to borrow?”\nWhen Lisa refused to pay, the man started berating her. He sent audio notes threatening her family and videos of front doors getting drenched in paint, a common intimidation technique employed by loansharks.\n“I was scared,” she said. “I was panicking and I didn’t know what to do. I just transferred whatever amount I had.”\nLisa eventually paid the man S$3,000, but instead of getting her loan, the man demanded that she settle a late fee as well.\nShe insisted that she had no money left, but the harassment continued. The man said he did not care about her circumstances, warning her that she needed to pay the fee by a certain deadline.\nAround that time, Lisa made a police report online, believing that she had been scammed and fearing for her children. She also told her family about what happened. They got angry and pressed her to ignore the threats and not transfer more money.\nAs Lisa waited for a response from the police, her family’s advice was less reassuring. She said she felt “alone” throughout her ordeal. “I was still panicking and I actually didn’t know what to do. I continued finding ways to pay them,” she added.\nShe soon cracked under the pressure and dipped into the “little bit” of savings she had left to pay off the admin fee.\nIn January 2021, her troubles escalated when more loansharks started harassing her and claiming she owed money. She suspected that her details were used to borrow from other illicit moneylenders.\nTo deter the loansharks, police officers installed a closed-circuit television camera outside her home for a period of time. Lisa said this could be why she has not been physically harassed.\nOne of the loansharks soon offered Lisa some kind of solution: If she handed over her ATM card, she could get about S$300 a month, ostensibly to service her debts.\nLisa was told she would get more money if she gave more ATM cards. At her wits’ end, she surrendered the cards to her three bank accounts.\n“I was having doubts also but I was scared. Because while they talked about this, they kept threatening about the money that I (supposedly) owed,” she said.\nPolice told CNA that scammers recruit mules to transfer stolen money on their behalf.\nCommon schemes include jobs that allow people to earn attractive salaries while working from home and performing \"relatively easy\" tasks, like using their personal bank account to receive and transfer money.\nMules are also asked to relinquish their Singpass, which may subsequently be used to register companies and open bank accounts.\n\"The offer can be between S$200 to S$2,000 for each bank account or Singpass relinquished, but most of the mules did not get their monies,\" police said.\nIndeed, Lisa said she never received any of the promised remuneration and could not check what her accounts were being used for. Her bank account PIN and online banking credentials were changed, and she said the bank could not attend to her unless she produced an ATM card.\nOn the back end, one of the banks flagged Lisa’s accounts to the police, suspicious that despite her modest income, tens of thousands of dollars were flooding through them each day.\nWorse still, the harassment and demands to settle her phantom debt carried on.\nWhenever Lisa agreed to pay something, the loansharks quickly gave her a list of bank accounts with corresponding amounts to transfer to. This is typical of how criminal syndicates operate, to complicate the money trail and take advantage of other victims.\n\"In general, a money mule’s actions help to perpetuate the criminal syndicate’s operations by aiding them to move the ill-gotten gains to avoid police’s detection,\" police said.\nWhile Lisa was still physically safe, the threats to her family were acted upon.\nIn Malaysia, loansharks splashed paint on another uncle’s house - not where her daughter lives - and later her grandmother’s house, the address of which was on her Malaysia identity card.\nBecause her Singapore identity card had her own address, she worried that it was only a matter of time before the loansharks got to her.\nShe said her husband had, against her wishes, previously whisked their son away for a week, and she feared that the loansharks could also take her child.\nWhen Lisa told the loansharks that she was in contact with the police, they got even more brazen and challenged officers to catch them.\nPolice started collating information about Lisa’s case - including the first report she made on the harassment - and summoned her for an interview sometime in March 2021. Lisa said she was “shocked” when she saw a letter from the police in the mailbox.\nLisa said she knew why she was being questioned, and insisted that she did not know what her account was being used for. The investigation officer considered the circumstances and eventually gave her a two-year conditional warning for being a money mule.\nThe police warned that people could still be prosecuted for being money mules even if they claim to be unaware of what they have done.\n\"Police would like to caution the public against dealing with money from unknown sources or assisting in the transfer and receipt of money without a licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore,\" it said.\n\"You should always reject requests to use your personal bank accounts to receive and transfer money for others.\"\nUltimately, the police said it takes a tough stance against money mule activities, adding that those convicted of money laundering could be jailed up to 10 years and fined up to S$500,000.\n\"If the money that you receive and transfer is stolen money or linked to crimes, you may be investigated and charged for committing a criminal offence,\" it stated.\nLisa said she continues to get harassed by loansharks to this day, citing how she sometimes get calls from them on numbers that look identical to that of her friends’.\n“When I answer, it’s actually a loanshark,” she said, adding that she would immediately say no and hang up when a stranger mentions her name. “It never ends, because they still contact me from time to time.”\nLisa said the entire incident has made it very difficult for her to trust people. She acknowledged that a mixture of fear and the fact that she had parted with cash made it difficult for her to escape the clutches of loansharks.\nShe lost more than S$5,000 in total, a sum she is not hopeful of getting back. She advised youths tempted to make a quick buck to find a job instead, and if they really needed to borrow money, to look for licensed moneylenders and visit their premises.\nThe Ministry of Law's website has a list of licensed moneylenders.\nLisa said her decision to click on that WhatsApp icon and chat with the first moneylender was the moment that changed her life.\n“I mean, if I never did that, all these wouldn’t have happened,” she added.\nIt is worth noting that Lisa's case is a little different from typical scam or money mule cases that involve some form of a carrot and stick approach. Lisa never received a single cent before being sucked into the scheme.\nMr Lee Rong Cheng, lead psychologist at the Singapore Police Force, said the circumstances in Lisa's case appeared to be \"very drastic\".\n\"The scammers may not think that there is a need to dangle any very significant carrot for her to be obliging to the scammer's suggestions, because the need on the victim's end is already so high,\" he explained.\n\"So in that sense, we can also see this as a resource management part on the scammer's end. As a whole, they are an organisation thinking of how to better allocate their resources as well. And this may have played out in this way for this particular victim.\"\nStill, Mr Lee pointed out that the scammer still dangled some form of reward in the middle of the scheme, by urging Lisa to hand over her bank accounts under the guise of facilitating quicker returns.\n\"The victim will not hesitate to do so, because they are just so much in a sense of anxiety and fearfulness that their commitment will go to waste,\" he said.\n\"Thus, they will just oblige to all the scammer's suggestions, and in turn, they unwittingly become money mules.\"\nThis fear stems from the constant harassment, Mr Lee said, noting that scammers will \"make you feel that they know a lot about you: Where you stay, what you normally do, who are in your family\".\n\"It gives you a very negative experience that you're now being targeted by someone, and that makes the person increasingly fearful of what else may happen,\" he said. \"What if I need to take my kids to school? Do they know where my kids are studying?\"\nThis leads to a \"continued sense of paranoia\" that further prevents the victim from making logical decisions, Mr Lee continued.\n\"It makes them potentially more vulnerable to suggestions from the harasser, like maybe this is the way to go to get out of this situation,\" he added.\n\"That tunnel vision actually works in the favour of the scammer.\"\nAnother factor could be age.\nA majority of those arrested for their involvement in scams in the first half of 2022 were aged 20 to 29, the latest police figures revealed.\nOf the total number of people police arrested in 2019 to 2021 for their involvement in scams reported in the year of their arrest, around 38 per cent were aged 20 to 29.\nWhen asked if younger people like Lisa were more susceptible to wanting to make a quick buck and ending up as money mules, Mr Lee said they could be a \"little bit more impressionable\".\n\"At the youth stage, the brain development hasn't matured yet, especially in terms of your prefrontal cortex that governs executive decision making,\" he added.\n\"And thus, youth in general may find it harder to resist temptation.\"\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nCopyright© Mediacorp 2025.

The investigation officer considered the circumstances and eventually gave her a two-year conditional warning for being a money mule.\nThe police warned that people could still be prosecuted for being money mules even if they claim to be unaware of what they have done.\n\"Police would like to caution the public against dealing with money from unknown sources or assisting in the transfer and receipt of money without a licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore,\" it said.\n\"You should always reject requests to use your personal bank accounts to receive and transfer money for others.\"\nUltimately, the police said it takes a tough stance against money mule activities, adding that those convicted of money laundering could be jailed up to 10 years and fined up to S$500,000.\n\"If the money that you receive and transfer is stolen money or linked to crimes, you may be investigated and charged for committing a criminal offence,\" it stated.\nLisa said she continues to get harassed by loansharks to this day, citing how she sometimes get calls from them on numbers that look identical to that of her friends’.\n“When I answer, it’s actually a loanshark,” she said, adding that she would immediately say no and hang up when a stranger mentions her name. “It never ends, because they still contact me from time to time.”\nLisa said the entire incident has made it very difficult for her to trust people. She acknowledged that a mixture of fear and the fact that she had parted with cash made it difficult for her to escape the clutches of loansharks.\nShe lost more than S$5,000 in total, a sum she is not hopeful of getting back. She advised youths tempted to make a quick buck to find a job instead, and if they really needed to borrow money, to look for licensed moneylenders and visit their premises.\nThe Ministry of Law's website has a list of licensed moneylenders.\nLisa said her decision to click on that WhatsApp icon and chat with the first moneylender was the moment that changed her life.\n“I mean, if I never did that, all these wouldn’t have happened,” she added.\nIt is worth noting that Lisa's case is a little different from typical scam or money mule cases that involve some form of a carrot and stick approach. Lisa never received a single cent before being sucked into the scheme.\nMr Lee Rong Cheng, lead psychologist at the Singapore Police Force, said the circumstances in Lisa's case appeared to be \"very drastic\".\n\"The scammers may not think that there is a need to dangle any very significant carrot for her to be obliging to the scammer's suggestions, because the need on the victim's end is already so high,\" he explained.\n\"So in that sense, we can also see this as a resource management part on the scammer's end. As a whole, they are an organisation thinking of how to better allocate their resources as well. And this may have played out in this way for this particular victim.\"\nStill, Mr Lee pointed out that the scammer still dangled some form of reward in the middle of the scheme, by urging Lisa to hand over her bank accounts under the guise of facilitating quicker returns.\n\"The victim will not hesitate to do so, because they are just so much in a sense of anxiety and fearfulness that their commitment will go to waste,\" he said.\n\"Thus, they will just oblige to all the scammer's suggestions, and in turn, they unwittingly become money mules.\"\nThis fear stems from the constant harassment, Mr Lee said, noting that scammers will \"make you feel that they know a lot about you: Where you stay, what you normally do, who are in your family\".\n\"It gives you a very negative experience that you're now being targeted by someone, and that makes the person increasingly fearful of what else may happen,\" he said. \"What if I need to take my kids to school? Do they know where my kids are studying?\"\nThis leads to a \"continued sense of paranoia\" that further prevents the victim from making logical decisions, Mr Lee continued.\n\"It makes them potentially more vulnerable to suggestions from the harasser, like maybe this is the way to go to get out of this situation,\" he added.\n\"That tunnel vision actually works in the favour of the scammer.\"\nAnother factor could be age.\nA majority of those arrested for their involvement in scams in the first half of 2022 were aged 20 to 29, the latest police figures revealed.\nOf the total number of people police arrested in 2019 to 2021 for their involvement in scams reported in the year of their arrest, around 38 per cent were aged 20 to 29.\nWhen asked if younger people like Lisa were more susceptible to wanting to make a quick buck and ending up as money mules, Mr Lee said they could be a \"little bit more impressionable\".\n\"At the youth stage, the brain development hasn't matured yet, especially in terms of your prefrontal cortex that governs executive decision making,\" he added.\n\"And thus, youth in general may find it harder to resist temptation.\"\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nCopyright© Mediacorp 2025.

Look no further than these reliable and historically high-yielding consumer staples giants.\nIf you are looking to build your wealth, one of the easiest ways is to buy reliable dividend stocks. One of the best places to find reliable dividend stocks is the consumer staples sector. Luckily for you, some of the most iconic consumer staples stocks look like they are on sale right now, including General Mills (GIS 0.01%), Clorox (CLX -1.96%), and PepsiCo (PEP 1.02%). Here's a look at each one.\nWall Street tends to think very short term, which is great news for investors with the wherewithal to think long term. Specifically, General Mills, one of the largest packaged food makers on the planet, is seeing a slowdown in its business. Sales dropped 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Thus, investors are shunning the stock, pushing its dividend yield up to a historically high 4.8%.\nGeneral Mills stands toe to toe with any of its peers as a business. It has a strong brand portfolio, it has an impressive innovation track record, and it has top-notch distribution and marketing strength as well. Right now, performance is weak because of shifting consumer trends and buying habits. That's not unusual -- the company is used to adjusting with the times. That's how it has managed to pay a dividend for 124 years.\nAlthough the dividend has not been increased every year, it has trended generally higher for decades. Unless you believe that people are going to suddenly stop eating, General Mills is probably going to find a way to get back on the growth track. It has done exactly that many times before over the past century or so.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nClorox is a bit different from General Mills. While General Mills is focused on food, Clorox is focused more on brands and categories where it believes it can be a sector leader. That has resulted in an eclectic brand portfolio that includes Burt's Bees, Brita, Glad, Hidden Valley, Fresh Step, Kingsford, and, of course, Clorox, among many others. In a few key niches, Clorox is the only branded product in the category, meaning it is the driving force for the product category.\nIt is an attractive model and has worked well over time. Clorox has increased its dividend annually for 48 consecutive years, two shy of Dividend King status. The dividend yield is historically high right now at around 3.8%.\nOne of the big problems for Clorox has been the fact that its margins got crushed after the coronavirus pandemic. That said, management has been working hard to fix that headwind and achieving material success. The company's gross margin has improved by around 10 percentage points from the low it saw in 2022. Cost cutting, streamlining, and innovation have all played a role. But the big picture is that Clorox isn't some fly-by-night consumer staples company. It's a proven survivor that has a high yield despite the success it's showing as it works to get its margins back.\nPepsiCo is another food maker, with a heavy focus on beverages (Pepsi) and salty snacks (Frito-Lay). It also makes packaged foods in its Quaker Oats business, but that's a smaller operation. Right now the company is a bit out of step with customers, and its growth has been lagging that of its most notable peers, including Coca-Cola (KO 1.42%). That has left investors shunning PepsiCo stock in favor of those peers.\nThis is a buying opportunity, considering the historically high 3.9% dividend yield. Like General Mills and Clorox, PepsiCo is an industry leading company when it comes to its competitive position. But even great companies go through hard times. The question is: What does a company do during the hard times? In PepsiCo's case, the answer is hunkering down and using the same playbook that has been so successful throughout the company's history.\nThe list of things PepsiCo is doing includes innovation, business optimization, and buying new brands to refresh its brand portfolio. These aren't exactly exciting things -- they're just business as usual. But that's how PepsiCo has become a Dividend King with over five decades of annual dividend increases behind it.\nWhen times get tough, PepsiCo doesn't flinch. It just keeps operating at a high level. History suggests that the beverage and snack giant will eventually get back on track. If you buy today, you can collect a lofty yield while you wait for better days.\nThe hard part with General Mills, Clorox, and PepsiCo is getting past each company's less-than-impressive recent business performance. To do that, simply focus on how well these companies have been run over the long term. Then you can easily justify buying these historically high-yielding stocks. What you get to do after that is sit back and collect big dividend checks while you wait for better days. History suggests that, given time, each of these iconic consumer staples makers will reward you well.\nReuben Gregg Brewer is a contributing Motley Fool Stock Market Analyst covering publicly traded companies in the energy, utility, REIT, and consumer staples areas.\n\n\n\nPrior to The Motley Fool, Reuben was the Director of Research at Value Line Publishing, an investment research company.

Hotel rooms at prime beach destinations can go for hundreds of dollars a night, bringing the total for just a place to sleep to almost $2,000.\nBut you don’t have to spend a fortune to get to the sea, sand and sun. There are deals to be had where rooms at beach destinations cost much less, both domestically and internationally.\n\"Our analysis of Hotels.com and Vrbo data shows that travelers can still find beachfront hotels and beach house rentals under $300 a night in top destinations across the U.S., Europe, and Southeast Asia for mid-August,\" Melanie Fish, Hotels.com and Vrbo travel expert, said in an email to NerdWallet.\nHere are a few suggestions for cheap beach vacations based on data from Expedia, an online travel booking platform, about some of the best deals out there.\nIt’s still possible to find domestic beach destinations for $200 or less a night, especially before the Memorial Day holiday, marking the unofficial beginning of summer. We looked at the average price for May 15-16.\nThese prices and locations are just a snapshot and a few suggestions. They might not be available when you look to make a reservation.\nAnd something else to keep in mind: At these prices you might not be able to step foot out of your hotel and be right on the sand.\nPanama City Beach, Florida.\nIn Panama City, Florida, the average rate of a hotel stay is $103 for the night of Aug. 15, according to Expedia. Panama City has 27 miles of shoreline along the Gulf of Mexico, so there are plenty of different beaches to find the atmosphere you're looking for. There are plenty of beachfront restaurants for a more lively vibe or state parks and an island only accessible by boat for a quiet getaway.\nVacation rentals in Panama City, Florida, average $160 for the night of Aug. 15.\nDowntown West Palm Beach, Florida.\nOver on the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Florida, Expedia found an average nightly rate under $200 ($173 to be exact) for hotels in West Palm Beach, Florida, for the night of Aug. 15. West Palm Beach is a city with plenty of waterfront restaurants and views on the Intracoastal Waterway. Plus, it's close to gorgeous beaches on some nearby barrier islands, including Jupiter and Palm Beach.\nOuter Banks, North Carolina.\nOutside of Florida, the Outer Banks in North Carolina, also offer some affordable rates under $200 for vacation rentals. On the night of Aug. 15, the average vacation rental rate is $185 for the night.\nThe Outer Banks is perfect for families looking for a quiet place to spend time together and go to the beach, maybe surf the sand dunes and fly kites. There are also some small beach towns and attractions like historic lighthouses and the site of the Wright brothers' first flight.\nSouth Beach and Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, Florida.\nIf you'd prefer an urban beach location, the big cities in Florida might be more affordable than you think. Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa all have average room rates under $250 per night for the night of Aug. 15.\nOrange Beach, Alabama, is just a short drive away from Gulf Shores.\nAlabama might be slightly closer or more affordable for some travelers, depending where they are coming from. Vrbo vacation rental rates average $190 per night and the beaches have soft white sand and gentle surf since it's on the Gulf of Mexico.\n» Learn more: The best hotel credit cards right now\nIf you'd rather travel internationally in August, check out some of these destinations.\nPanoramic aerial view of Pattaya Gulf, Thailand in a summer day\nExpedia shows an incredible average rate of $91 a night for Aug. 15 to Aug. 16 in Pattaya, Thailand, but August is the rainy season in Thailand. September or October is a shoulder season that might give travelers better chances of sunny days.\nPattaya is a lively (and crowded) beach destination is famous for water sports and a bustling beachfront area of hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops.\nYou can also get there from Bangkok without taking a ferry or another flight. It's about a 2.5-hour drive from Bangkok without traffic.\nJust keep in mind, while the rooms might be cheap, the plane tickets are not. A flight from L.A. to Bangkok starts at about $800 round-trip and would require at least one stop.\nIf you don't mind adding another flight, Phuket, Thailand, is another beach city with average hotel rates of $122 for the night of Aug. 15.\nA small beach in Armenistis, a village on Ikaria island.\nThe North Aegean Islands, which includes islands such as Ikaria, Samos, Limnos and others, can give travelers the Greek island experience at a very affordable rate. The average nightly rate is just $189 per night. These islands are known for the crystal clear waters and charming villages.

Sign up for Dispatches to get our stories in your inbox every week.\nWhen Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon toured the public school in Sleetmute last fall, he called the building “the poster child” for what’s wrong with the way the state pays to build and maintain schools. The tiny community 240 miles west of Anchorage had begged Alaska’s education department for nearly two decades for money to repair a leaky roof that over time had left part of the school on the verge of collapse.\nSeated at a cafeteria table after the tour, Edgmon, a veteran independent lawmaker, told a Yup’ik elder he planned to “start raising a little bit of Cain” when he returned to the Capitol in Juneau for the 2025 legislative session.\nOther lawmakers said similar things after an investigation by KYUK Public Media, ProPublica and NPR earlier this year found that the state has largely ignored hundreds of requests from rural school districts to fix deteriorating buildings, including the Sleetmute school. Because of the funding failures, students and teachers in some of Alaska’s most remote villages face serious health and safety risks, the news organizations found.\nSen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, an Anchorage Democrat, called the investigation’s findings “heartbreaking” and said in an email during the legislative session earlier this year that “the current state of these schools is unacceptable.” Sen. Scott Kawasaki, a Fairbanks Democrat, wrote to say that the “responsibility lies squarely on the legislature” and acknowledged “we do not do enough.” Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican who represents part of Anchorage, wrote, “We are working to right the ship!”\nYet during a legislative session where money for education was front and center, lawmakers were only able to pass $40 million in school construction and maintenance funding, about 5% of the nearly $800 million that districts say they need to keep their buildings safe and operating.\nIn June, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed more than two-thirds of that, nearly $28 million.\n“Basically, we don’t have enough money to pay for all of our obligations,” Dunleavy explained in a video posted on YouTube.\nIn the video, seated at an empty table in a darkened room and flanked by U.S. and Alaska flags, Dunleavy, a Republican, painted a grim picture of the state’s future. “The price of oil has gone down; therefore our revenue is going down,” he said.\nThe crisis Dunleavy described isn’t just a short-term problem. State officials have known for decades that relying on oil to fund the budget is risky as prices and production have declined. But year after year, they have failed to agree on a solution to finance school repairs and renovations. Alaska is one of only two states without an income tax or statewide sales tax.\nAverage annual spending on education facilities declined by nearly 60% after 2014, the year oil prices plummeted, according to a 2021 report by the University of Alaska Anchorage. Overall spending on rural facilities is now less than half of what the National Council on School Facilities recommends.\nSen. Löki Tobin, a Democrat from Anchorage who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said it’s hard to get “momentum” around various ideas to fund education, “let alone just getting folks to realize that we have been by attrition defunding our schools.”\nAlaska’s Legislature seemed primed this year to address education funding. Several new candidates from both parties campaigned on education and won seats in November’s statewide election.\n“We flipped an entire statehouse,” said Tobin, who was elected to the Legislature in 2022, “based on the question of adequate school funding.”\nLawmakers filed a bill to fund education before the session even began. And in the first months of the year, dozens of superintendents, students and school board members traveled to Juneau to testify before lawmakers and urge them to increase funding for curriculum, teacher salaries and other costs.\nDuring one Senate Finance Committee hearing, panel co-chair Lyman Hoffman, who has represented rural Alaskan school districts for 38 years, raised the specter of a civil rights lawsuit similar to those the state has faced in the past over education in primarily Indigenous communities.\nThe prospect, he said, could be “more costly to the state than if we came forward and tried to do something about the condition of these schools.”\nIn April, Alaska’s House and Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would have offered the largest increase in nearly a decade in what the state spends on each student annually. It did not include capital funds for school construction or maintenance.\nDays later, Dunleavy, a former superintendent and school board member, vetoed it. He said it didn’t include enough support for homeschooling and charter schools — policy changes that he’s long pushed for.\nBefore the legislative session adjourned in May, lawmakers passed a compromise bill that included less spending and eased regulations for charter schools. Dunleavy again vetoed it, but lawmakers overrode the veto. The next month, Dunleavy used his line-item veto power to slash 3% from the education budget, the largest cut to any department in the state.\nThis year’s total state budget came to $14.7 billion, about $1 billion less than the previous year. Some lawmakers have described it as “bare bones” and “flat funded.”\nAmong Dunleavy’s cuts was more than $25 million that was supposed to pay for school construction and maintenance. School districts have to apply to the state for those funds each year, and their proposed projects are then ranked. The reduction doesn’t leave enough money this year to pay for even the top three projects among the 84 maintenance proposals school districts submitted. Seventeen major construction projects, including the replacement of five rural schools, received no funding at all.\nOne of those projects is a new school in Stebbins, a Yup’ik village on the coast of the Norton Sound and the Bering Sea where the building burned down last year. More than 200 K-12 students now attend classes in about a dozen small temporary buildings. Mayor Sharon Snowball said several students left the community after the fire to attend boarding school or live with family in other communities.\nTwo hundred miles southwest in Mertarvik, a village that recently relocated due to climate change, the school district did not receive the funds it applied for to build a wastewater system for a school that’s set to open in 2026. The district said it couldn’t answer questions about how it will move forward with the project.\nDunleavy has called lawmakers back to Juneau on Aug. 2 for a special session to discuss reforming the state’s education system. It’s unclear whether maintenance and construction funds will be part of those discussions.\nAlaska’s budget crisis has been detrimental to the state’s rural school districts, which rely almost entirely on the annual budget for funding to fix and maintain buildings because they serve unincorporated communities that don’t have the power to levy taxes.\nThe budget depends heavily on profits from the production and sale of crude oil, which go into the state’s Permanent Fund, a state-owned investment fund. Returns on those investments pay for more than half of Alaska’s operational needs each year.\nPrices of crude oil from Alaska’s North Slope dropped by more than a third from 2014 to this spring, according to the Alaska Department of Revenue. The result is a budget deficit that some economists say will exceed $1 billion by next year.\nState lawmakers have failed to address the warning signs of a budget crisis for decades. By the early 2000s, Alaska’s daily oil production had fallen by half from its peak in the 1980s. Last year, it was a quarter of that.\nBut for a time, high oil prices allowed Alaska to make it work. When Edgmon came into office in 2007, he said every day was a windfall.\n“We put a ton of money into schools both operationally and capital budgetwise,” he said.\nLegislators have weighed numerous options to fund the budget. They’ve considered whether to trim the annual dividend checks that Alaska pays to its year-round residents from the return on Permanent Fund investments. Last year, Alaskans received just over $1,700. Cutting payments is wildly unpopular, in part because research has shown the money reduces the number of Alaskans in poverty by up to 40%.\nLawmakers have dipped into the state’s dwindling savings accounts to cover the deficit, said Matt Berman, a University of Alaska Anchorage economics professor who co-authored a 2016 report that examined various deficit-reduction methods.\n“The fact that the study was done 10 years ago and that absolutely no action has taken place since then speaks for itself,” Berman wrote in an email.\nSome lawmakers have long called for Alaska to adopt a statewide income or sales tax, but neither idea has gained much traction. A bipartisan working group studied the possibility of enacting taxes in 2021. After a year on the working group, state Rep. Kevin McCabe, a Republican from north of Anchorage, said he wasn’t convinced taxes were the answer.\n“We experimented with sales tax, maybe a seasonal sales tax, we tried an income tax, progressive income tax,” he said. “It’s just not gonna bring in the money that we need for all of our infrastructure deficit.”\nAlaska used to have a special tax on every employed resident to help pay for education. But it was repealed in 1980 after the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which allowed the state to sell more oil from North Slope.\n“I’ll never forget my first payroll check,” said Click Bishop, a former six-term Republican senator from Fairbanks. He said his boss went through the statement with him. “He gets down here on this line, and it says ‘education head tax $5,’ and he said, ‘Kid, that $5 is going to the state to help you get your education,’” he recalled.\nRead More\nBishop, who is exploring a run for governor, has proposed reinstating an annual education tax. But his proposal would only raise about $14 million each year, hardly enough to scratch the surface on the state’s school maintenance needs.\nInstead of taxes, McCabe and other lawmakers say a more long-term solution for both schools and Alaska’s overall budget would be to build a natural gas pipeline that would raise money from gas sales.\nEstimates from the U.S. Geological Survey show the state is home to more than a hundred trillion cubic feet of untapped natural gas, but there’s no way to bring it to market.\nDescribed by the industry as “big, expensive and complex,” the pipeline project has been in discussions for at least 50 years. In 2020, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., an independent state corporation tasked with developing the infrastructure, estimated construction could cost close to $40 billion. Though an energy developer recently announced interest from dozens of international customers, it’s unclear who would foot that bill.\nAug. 1, 2025: This story originally misstated the district that Alaska Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel represents.

Mayor Sharon Snowball said several students left the community after the fire to attend boarding school or live with family in other communities.\nTwo hundred miles southwest in Mertarvik, a village that recently relocated due to climate change, the school district did not receive the funds it applied for to build a wastewater system for a school that’s set to open in 2026. The district said it couldn’t answer questions about how it will move forward with the project.\nDunleavy has called lawmakers back to Juneau on Aug. 2 for a special session to discuss reforming the state’s education system. It’s unclear whether maintenance and construction funds will be part of those discussions.\nAlaska’s budget crisis has been detrimental to the state’s rural school districts, which rely almost entirely on the annual budget for funding to fix and maintain buildings because they serve unincorporated communities that don’t have the power to levy taxes.\nThe budget depends heavily on profits from the production and sale of crude oil, which go into the state’s Permanent Fund, a state-owned investment fund. Returns on those investments pay for more than half of Alaska’s operational needs each year.\nPrices of crude oil from Alaska’s North Slope dropped by more than a third from 2014 to this spring, according to the Alaska Department of Revenue. The result is a budget deficit that some economists say will exceed $1 billion by next year.\nState lawmakers have failed to address the warning signs of a budget crisis for decades. By the early 2000s, Alaska’s daily oil production had fallen by half from its peak in the 1980s. Last year, it was a quarter of that.\nBut for a time, high oil prices allowed Alaska to make it work. When Edgmon came into office in 2007, he said every day was a windfall.\n“We put a ton of money into schools both operationally and capital budgetwise,” he said.\nLegislators have weighed numerous options to fund the budget. They’ve considered whether to trim the annual dividend checks that Alaska pays to its year-round residents from the return on Permanent Fund investments. Last year, Alaskans received just over $1,700. Cutting payments is wildly unpopular, in part because research has shown the money reduces the number of Alaskans in poverty by up to 40%.\nLawmakers have dipped into the state’s dwindling savings accounts to cover the deficit, said Matt Berman, a University of Alaska Anchorage economics professor who co-authored a 2016 report that examined various deficit-reduction methods.\n“The fact that the study was done 10 years ago and that absolutely no action has taken place since then speaks for itself,” Berman wrote in an email.\nSome lawmakers have long called for Alaska to adopt a statewide income or sales tax, but neither idea has gained much traction. A bipartisan working group studied the possibility of enacting taxes in 2021. After a year on the working group, state Rep. Kevin McCabe, a Republican from north of Anchorage, said he wasn’t convinced taxes were the answer.\n“We experimented with sales tax, maybe a seasonal sales tax, we tried an income tax, progressive income tax,” he said. “It’s just not gonna bring in the money that we need for all of our infrastructure deficit.”\nAlaska used to have a special tax on every employed resident to help pay for education. But it was repealed in 1980 after the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which allowed the state to sell more oil from North Slope.\n“I’ll never forget my first payroll check,” said Click Bishop, a former six-term Republican senator from Fairbanks. He said his boss went through the statement with him. “He gets down here on this line, and it says ‘education head tax $5,’ and he said, ‘Kid, that $5 is going to the state to help you get your education,’” he recalled.\nRead More\nBishop, who is exploring a run for governor, has proposed reinstating an annual education tax. But his proposal would only raise about $14 million each year, hardly enough to scratch the surface on the state’s school maintenance needs.\nInstead of taxes, McCabe and other lawmakers say a more long-term solution for both schools and Alaska’s overall budget would be to build a natural gas pipeline that would raise money from gas sales.\nEstimates from the U.S. Geological Survey show the state is home to more than a hundred trillion cubic feet of untapped natural gas, but there’s no way to bring it to market.\nDescribed by the industry as “big, expensive and complex,” the pipeline project has been in discussions for at least 50 years. In 2020, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., an independent state corporation tasked with developing the infrastructure, estimated construction could cost close to $40 billion. Though an energy developer recently announced interest from dozens of international customers, it’s unclear who would foot that bill.\nAug. 1, 2025: This story originally misstated the district that Alaska Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel represents.

Sign up for Dispatches to get our stories in your inbox every week.\nWhen Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon toured the public school in Sleetmute last fall, he called the building “the poster child” for what’s wrong with the way the state pays to build and maintain schools. The tiny community 240 miles west of Anchorage had begged Alaska’s education department for nearly two decades for money to repair a leaky roof that over time had left part of the school on the verge of collapse.\nSeated at a cafeteria table after the tour, Edgmon, a veteran independent lawmaker, told a Yup’ik elder he planned to “start raising a little bit of Cain” when he returned to the Capitol in Juneau for the 2025 legislative session.\nOther lawmakers said similar things after an investigation by KYUK Public Media, ProPublica and NPR earlier this year found that the state has largely ignored hundreds of requests from rural school districts to fix deteriorating buildings, including the Sleetmute school. Because of the funding failures, students and teachers in some of Alaska’s most remote villages face serious health and safety risks, the news organizations found.\nSen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, an Anchorage Democrat, called the investigation’s findings “heartbreaking” and said in an email during the legislative session earlier this year that “the current state of these schools is unacceptable.” Sen. Scott Kawasaki, a Fairbanks Democrat, wrote to say that the “responsibility lies squarely on the legislature” and acknowledged “we do not do enough.” Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican who represents part of Anchorage, wrote, “We are working to right the ship!”\nYet during a legislative session where money for education was front and center, lawmakers were only able to pass $40 million in school construction and maintenance funding, about 5% of the nearly $800 million that districts say they need to keep their buildings safe and operating.\nIn June, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed more than two-thirds of that, nearly $28 million.\n“Basically, we don’t have enough money to pay for all of our obligations,” Dunleavy explained in a video posted on YouTube.\nIn the video, seated at an empty table in a darkened room and flanked by U.S. and Alaska flags, Dunleavy, a Republican, painted a grim picture of the state’s future. “The price of oil has gone down; therefore our revenue is going down,” he said.\nThe crisis Dunleavy described isn’t just a short-term problem. State officials have known for decades that relying on oil to fund the budget is risky as prices and production have declined. But year after year, they have failed to agree on a solution to finance school repairs and renovations. Alaska is one of only two states without an income tax or statewide sales tax.\nAverage annual spending on education facilities declined by nearly 60% after 2014, the year oil prices plummeted, according to a 2021 report by the University of Alaska Anchorage. Overall spending on rural facilities is now less than half of what the National Council on School Facilities recommends.\nSen. Löki Tobin, a Democrat from Anchorage who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said it’s hard to get “momentum” around various ideas to fund education, “let alone just getting folks to realize that we have been by attrition defunding our schools.”\nAlaska’s Legislature seemed primed this year to address education funding. Several new candidates from both parties campaigned on education and won seats in November’s statewide election.\n“We flipped an entire statehouse,” said Tobin, who was elected to the Legislature in 2022, “based on the question of adequate school funding.”\nLawmakers filed a bill to fund education before the session even began. And in the first months of the year, dozens of superintendents, students and school board members traveled to Juneau to testify before lawmakers and urge them to increase funding for curriculum, teacher salaries and other costs.\nDuring one Senate Finance Committee hearing, panel co-chair Lyman Hoffman, who has represented rural Alaskan school districts for 38 years, raised the specter of a civil rights lawsuit similar to those the state has faced in the past over education in primarily Indigenous communities.\nThe prospect, he said, could be “more costly to the state than if we came forward and tried to do something about the condition of these schools.”\nIn April, Alaska’s House and Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would have offered the largest increase in nearly a decade in what the state spends on each student annually. It did not include capital funds for school construction or maintenance.\nDays later, Dunleavy, a former superintendent and school board member, vetoed it. He said it didn’t include enough support for homeschooling and charter schools — policy changes that he’s long pushed for.\nBefore the legislative session adjourned in May, lawmakers passed a compromise bill that included less spending and eased regulations for charter schools. Dunleavy again vetoed it, but lawmakers overrode the veto. The next month, Dunleavy used his line-item veto power to slash 3% from the education budget, the largest cut to any department in the state.\nThis year’s total state budget came to $14.7 billion, about $1 billion less than the previous year. Some lawmakers have described it as “bare bones” and “flat funded.”\nAmong Dunleavy’s cuts was more than $25 million that was supposed to pay for school construction and maintenance. School districts have to apply to the state for those funds each year, and their proposed projects are then ranked. The reduction doesn’t leave enough money this year to pay for even the top three projects among the 84 maintenance proposals school districts submitted. Seventeen major construction projects, including the replacement of five rural schools, received no funding at all.\nOne of those projects is a new school in Stebbins, a Yup’ik village on the coast of the Norton Sound and the Bering Sea where the building burned down last year. More than 200 K-12 students now attend classes in about a dozen small temporary buildings. Mayor Sharon Snowball said several students left the community after the fire to attend boarding school or live with family in other communities.\nTwo hundred miles southwest in Mertarvik, a village that recently relocated due to climate change, the school district did not receive the funds it applied for to build a wastewater system for a school that’s set to open in 2026.

The company has increased its payout every year since 2009, but with cigarette volumes continuing to decline, the question on many investors' minds is whether the dividend and its increased payouts are sustainable.\nLet's look at the company's recent results to find out.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nIn the second quarter, Altria saw solid adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth and raised its earnings guidance, although it is still facing headwinds.\nOverall revenue net of excise taxes fell 1.7% to $5.29 billion, while adjusted EPS climbed 8.3% to $1.44. That was above analyst expectations for revenue of $5.19 billion and EPS of $1.39, as compiled by FactSet.\nAltria's on! nicotine pouches, which compete with Philip Morris International's Zyn, saw strong growth, with shipment volumes climbing 26.5% to 52.1 million cans. Revenue net of excise taxes in the oral products segment that houses on! rose 6% to $728 million. Segment shipment volumes fell 1% to 198.6 million units. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 10.9% to $500 million.\nThe company's cigarette business continues to experience large shipment declines, with overall shipment volumes down 10.2%. Its leading Marlboro brand saw shipments fall 11.4% in the quarter, while other premium brand shipments sank 13%. Discount brand shipments jumped 17.6%, while cigar volumes rose 3.7%.\nFor its smokeable segment, revenue net of excise taxes fell 0.4% to $4.6 billion. Adjusted operating income for the segment increased 4.2% to $2.95 billion.\nAltria's Njoy e-vapor business is currently in a patent dispute with Juul, in which it previously had a large stake. It lost the trial and subsequent appeal, and it just recently completed a new product design for its Njoy Ace solution in an effort to work around the patents it violated.\nLooking ahead, the company raised the low end of its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $5.35 to $5.45, representing 3% to 5% growth. That's up from a prior range of $5.30 to $5.45.\nAltria currently pays a dividend of $1.02 a quarter, or an annual rate of $4.08. The company generated $2.9 billion in both operating cash flow and free cash flow through the first six months of the year. Meanwhile, it paid $3.5 billion in dividends over the same period.\nThrough the first six months of the year, its cash flows are not covering its dividend payout, which can be a red flag. However, last year it covered the $6.8 billion in dividends it paid out with free cash flows of $8.6 billion, and it tends to generate much more cash flow in the second half of the year.\nLooking at its balance sheet, Altria ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 2 times, which is reasonable. As such, the dividend looks sustainable for the foreseeable future.\nThe big concern for investors is the steady, large drop in cigarette volumes. At some point, price hikes stop working, and that's a real risk. Tobacco companies have strong pricing power, but there's only so much Altria can do when fewer people are buying its products each year. And while on! is showing solid growth, it's still a small piece of the overall revenue puzzle.\nFrom a valuation perspective, the company trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.5 based on the analyst consensus for 2025. That's much cheaper than its former unit, Philip Morris International, but I much prefer its international counterpart given its strong growth drivers.\nOverall, Altria is a solid dividend play.

    "title": "Aluminum Prices Continue to Hold Steady Amid Globa 20250804 061538",
    "content": "Sohrab Darabshaw | Posted on July 30, 2025 |\nRecent movements in aluminum prices show the metal holding strong despite global economic shifts and region-specific challenges in extraction and refining operations.\nOn July 25, aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange climbed to a four-month high, ending the week at US $2,656.5 and US $2,657 per ton, an increase of $10.5 or 0.39%. According to reports, the uptick was primarily fueled by renewed optimism in Chinese demand and mounting pressure from global supply constraints.\nOn the same day, the three-month bid price and three-month offer price climbed US $7.5 per ton or 0.28% to stop the march at US $2,655.5 per ton and US $2,656 per ton. The next week, aluminum spot prices were trading at $2,635.85 per metric ton, slightly down from the recent high of July 25. Still, prices remain on the higher side due to a mix of supply-side restrictions and renewed infrastructure demand from major economies.\nConcerned about fluctuating aluminum prices? Conquer unpredictable metal markets with a steady stream of price risk alerts and cost-saving strategies by signing up for MetalMiner’s weekly newsletter.\nAccording to market observers, the present aluminum bull run stems from several factors. High on that list is China’s production cap. China is the world’s largest aluminum producer, but it is nearing its 45 MT annual cap, a policy aimed at curbing carbon emissions. This has led to expectations of reduced output in the second half of the year.\nThe rising demand from fast-growing sectors like electric vehicles and renewable energy is another big reason for aluminum prices holding steady. This comes at a time when European Union nations are increasing their investments in defense manufacturing, thus boosting demand for industrial metals like aluminum. Added to that are the ongoing sanctions against Russia, a key aluminum exporter, which continue to limit supply to European markets.\nOther factors include:\nCaught off guard by sudden aluminum price shifts? Subscribe now to MetalMiner’s Monthly Metals Index Report and stay prepared with timely insights into market changes across eight metal industries, helping you mitigate price risk.\nFor North America, tariff policies, most notably Section 232, continue to shape the dynamics of the U.S. aluminum sector. According to reports, while domestic output continues to hold firm, supply is being bolstered by imports, particularly from Canada and Middle Eastern countries.\nThe aluminum industry was jolted in June when the United States doubled its Section 232 tariffs to 50%, sparking dramatic cost shifts and forcing top producers to overhaul supply strategies. The move put producers under pressure, but according to analysts, they have pivoted well.\nFor example, aluminum leader Alcoa, facing the brunt of rising tariffs like other producers, rerouted Canadian exports to Europe and Asia and divested non-core assets. Another heavyweight, Rio Tinto, which is heavily reliant on U.S. exports from Canada, absorbed US $321 million in tariffs during H1. As per this report, about 723,000 tonnes of aluminum flowed south, amplifying cost burdens.\nIndustry leaders have warned that prolonged trade friction could weaken global aluminum consumption and curb growth. While some companies experience short-term benefits from tightened regional supply, many are bracing for deeper structural changes if tariffs persist, with others lobbying for relief.\nHowever, there are some positives that the market can hold onto for the near term. The announcement of a ¥1.2 trillion hydroelectric dam has signaled Beijing’s intent to stimulate its economy through infrastructure investment. This move is expected to bolster demand for aluminum in the construction, energy and transportation sectors.\nThat said, Beijing’s stringent energy consumption policies, particularly in provinces such as Yunnan and Inner Mongolia, have triggered production curtailments, tightening global aluminum supply and driving price volatility.\nAmid these disruptions, India is emerging as a key growth market. Backed by abundant bauxite reserves and an expanding network of downstream industries, the country’s aluminum sector continues to gain momentum. Analysts expect domestic demand to surge in the coming years, propelled by rising infrastructure development and increased transportation activity.\nSeeing your volume discounts fall flat?

    "content": "Advertisement\nAstonishing new archaeological finds and ancient DNA analysis leave no doubt that throughout prehistory women were rulers, warriors, hunters and shamans\nBy Laura Spinney\n30 July 2025\n                                    Last updated 30 July 2025\nJay Gorden\nJay Gorden\nThe young man, no older than 25, had gone to the afterlife with an opulent assortment of grave goods, including an entire elephant tusk. Archaeologists who excavated his 5000-year-old remains in 2008 from a site near Seville, Spain, dubbed him the “Ivory Man” and suggested that he might have been the most important person on the Iberian peninsula in his lifetime. So it came as a shock when, 13 years later, analysis of proteins in his tooth enamel revealed that he wasn’t male at all. The Ivory Man was, in fact, the “Ivory Lady”.\nPerhaps this re-sexing shouldn’t have come as such a surprise. Of late, the ability to probe ancient biological remains has led to the discovery of prehistoric women in all sorts of unexpected places. It turns out they have occupied roles and positions that would have confounded 20th-century researchers. Whether in the form of Stone Age women spearing bison, Neolithic ones controlling the allocation of land, or the sensational case of a Viking warrior who, like the Ivory Lady, was belatedly identified as female, the new evidence is rocking our understanding of how ancient societies viewed gender roles.\nNobody is suggesting that women and men were treated as equals in the ancient world, much less that it was a feminist paradise. Indeed, man-centred societies were probably the norm. But enough exceptions have come to light to suggest a breathtaking variety of social organisation. “There’s no one idea of womanhood or masculinity,” says archaeologist Rachel Pope at the University of Liverpool, UK. “Instead, there’s real variation in social norms across time and space.” Finally, we are unearthing prehistory’s powerful women.\nRead moreThe remarkable tale of how humans nearly didn’t conquer the world\nRead more\nThe remarkable tale of how humans nearly didn’t conquer the world\nDespite huge leaps in equality over the past century, today’s societies are still largely patriarchal. Archaeologists have long been taught that this status quo got its foothold when farming became widespread, starting around 10,000 years ago. Hunter-gatherer groups are generally seen as egalitarian, albeit with men and women doing different types of work. But, the idea goes, as societies became more sedentary and began generating wealth in the form of surplus food, people started to attach importance to inheritance, and rules were established for transferring wealth from fathers to sons. With wealth came male power and female oppression. Or so argued Karl Marx’s collaborator, the political theorist Friedrich Engels, in the late 1800s. “That model supported a particular political system and was based on no archaeological evidence,” says Penny Bickle, archaeologist at the University of York, UK.\nA rival idea, put forward in the 1960s by Lithuanian archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, suggested that Europe’s oldest farming societies were woman-centric and thrived until 5000 years ago, when herders arrived from the steppes and imposed their patriarchal world view. It has, however, proved equally unfounded. These grand narratives, which invoke a single inflection point, no longer fit the data, says Bickle. The advent of new archaeological tools – notably the ability to analyse not only ancient DNA (aDNA), but also proteins and isotopes, or variants of elements consumed as food – reveal both ideas to be overly simplistic. “We shouldn’t be writing origin stories like these,” she says. Instead, what’s emerging is a more complex picture, showing how economic and historical context powerfully shaped the way men and women lived – and that societies were capable of flipping from one system to another within centuries, if conditions changed.\nSubscriber-only newsletter\nEach month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more.\nAnalysis of these societies also highlights the distinction between biological sex – including the ability to bear children – and gender, referring to our habit of assigning people distinct cultural attributes – masculine or feminine – based on their sex. Archaeologist Jennifer French at the University of Liverpool thinks that the concept of gender emerged with symbolic thinking, and that early Stone Age art and burial rites suggest the first modern humans were familiar with it, as were Neanderthals. Despite this, some researchers prefer to talk about “males” and “females” in that period, rather than “men” and “women”. “To me, it seems a little dehumanising,” she says.\nThe temple of the Egyptian ruler Hatshepsut remains a testament to one of the most powerful womenUwe Skrzypczak/imageBROKER.com/Alamy\nThe temple of the Egyptian ruler Hatshepsut remains a testament to one of the most powerful women\nUwe Skrzypczak/imageBROKER.com/Alamy\nNevertheless, the early Stone Age is largely a black box when it comes to gender roles. “Sexed burials with accompanying material culture, and iconographic artefacts, are either absent or rare,” says French. The tiny glimpses that archaeology and aDNA have afforded, combined with ethnographic evidence from modern or historical hunter-gatherer societies, hint that patrilocality and female exogamy were the norm. In other words, couples moved to live with the man’s family. However, because these groups tended to be small, they probably had to be adaptable, so matrilocal societies, where women stayed with their kin, may also sometimes have emerged.\nMatrilocal societies tend to give women greater participation in communal life, says anthropologist Carol Ember at Yale University, probably because, with family around, women are less likely to be defined exclusively as wives and mothers. This is especially true if resources – importantly, land – pass through the female line. And this matrilineal system of inheritance often goes together with matrilocality. According to a hypothesis developed by Ember and her husband Melvin Ember, who was also an anthropologist, matrilocality is most likely to emerge when women are the main workers in a subsistence economy – making it preferable that daughters stay at home – and when there is no threat of war, so families have no need to keep their sons close to help defend the household. This suggests that matrilocality would have been the exception in prehistory, because intergroup violence was so common. But there are other factors favouring women-centred societies, including situations where the paternity of children is uncertain and where groups have a history of migration.\nRead moreThe archaeologist fighting claims about an advanced lost civilisation\nRead more\nThe archaeologist fighting claims about an advanced lost civilisation\nThat covers the theory. On the ground, studying gender in prehistoric remains is complicated by the fact that how people were placed in burials may not reflect how they lived. Stable isotope analysis can help, by showing – through the detection of dietary changes – whether people died in the same place where they grew up. Genetics can help too, by revealing biological links among groups that recurred over generations and regions. Even then, interpreting the evidence can be tricky. Power maps onto patterns of post-marital residence and inheritance in different ways. Trickier still, says Pope, is that “there isn’t a demonstrable link between grave wealth and power”.\nA case in point is the early farming community that inhabited the 9000-year-old site of Çatalhöyük in modern Turkey. Archaeologists consider this group to have been egalitarian, in that men and women had similar diets and did similar kinds of work. But, in a new genetic study, Eren Yüncü at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara and her colleagues show that the society was matrilocal and that young women were accorded more lavish grave goods than men. This doesn’t necessarily mean that women pulled the strings at Çatalhöyük, however. “Grave goods often express the lost reproductive potential when young women die,” says archaeologist Katharina Rebay-Salisbury at the University of Vienna, Austria.\nExceptional though they have been, matrilocal or matrilineal societies have now been documented on every inhabited continent in the ancient world. The first humans to reach the remote islands of Oceania, around 3000 years ago, were matrilocal, according to a 2022 study led by geneticist Yue-Chen Liu at Harvard University. The earliest farming societies in Thailand probably were, too. And in 2017, geneticists detected a high-status matrilineal group that persisted for more than 300 years in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico – an important ritual and political centre in North America around the 10th century – whose modern descendants include the matrilineal Zuni and Hopi peoples.\nFu Hao, one of the wives of King Wu Ding of the Shang dynasty, was a military general and high priestessImaginechina Limited/Alamy\nFu Hao, one of the wives of King Wu Ding of the Shang dynasty, was a military general and high priestess\nImaginechina Limited/Alamy\nBut there is a paradox. “In the matrilocal, matrilineal societies that we have studied in the recent anthropological record, women were never political leaders,” says Ember. They had higher status and more influence than women in patrilocal, patrilineal societies, but they didn’t make the decisions. That was typically the preserve of their brothers, who were often more heavily invested in their sisters’ children than in their own. This prompts the question of what we mean by power. There are famous cases of women who took on the trappings of masculine-coded hard power, with an emphasis on physical strength and domination. The Egyptian pharaoh Hatshepsut, who reigned in the 15th century BC, sported kingly regalia, commissioned monuments and initiated at least one military campaign. The Mayan ruler Lady K’awiil Ajaw of Cobá presided over a formidable group of warriors and statesmen in the 7th century and is thought to have built a 100-kilometre road to display her authority. In general, though, women have exerted power differently from men.\nThis is highlighted in a study by political anthropologist Paula Sabloff at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, who compared the roles of royal women across eight pre-modern states. The women included queens who had acted as regents, such as Lady Fu Hao in China’s Shang dynasty more than 3000 years ago, and spouses who had deputised for their royal husbands, like the wives of Zimri-Lim, who led the Mari in what is now eastern Syria in the 18th century BC. The states spanned five continents and more than 4000 years and had different cultural norms regarding inheritance, post-marital residence and female rulers themselves. Yet, Sabloff found that in all eight, women wielded power in the same ways: by influencing policy; influencing the actions of those above and below them in rank; acting as go-betweens; and patronising clients. “That’s real power, too,” says Rebay-Salisbury.\nUnderstanding this female propensity for soft power lends a different hue to some recent findings from prehistory. For instance, a man and woman found together in a grave in southern Spain, along with 30 precious metal and gemstone artefacts, are among several examples of couples who seem to have ruled jointly in the Bronze Age. They may have had equal status, while deploying different leadership skills. Or consider two kings who ruled over the Celtic Hallstatt culture of south-west Germany around 2500 years ago. Their graves are among the richest burials in European prehistory. A recent aDNA analysis reveals that they were probably a nephew and his maternal uncle, indicating that a woman linked them, even though she wasn’t buried with them.\nExcavation of Durotriges burials found that women’s graves were more lavish than men’sBournemouth University\nExcavation of Durotriges burials found that women’s graves were more lavish than men’s\nBournemouth University\nBut not all female power was so indirect, as new findings about another Celtic tribe make clear. The study, by geneticist Lara Cassidy at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and her colleagues, looked at the Durotriges, who inhabited southern Britain two millennia ago – around the time that the Romans invaded. The genomic analysis of 57 individuals showed that the society was matrilocal and matrilineal, with men joining the group from outside, and that Durotrigian women went to the afterlife with more grave wealth than their male counterparts. Add to this evidence that they took up arms against the Romans and the assertion, by Roman chroniclers, that the Celtic women of Britain were fierce and liberated – most famously Boudica, who led the Iceni tribe in a revolt against the Roman invaders – and there seems little doubt that the Durotriges themselves recognised female power.\nThe line between male and female power isn’t always clear-cut, though. Also around two millennia ago, an individual was buried on one of the Scilly Isles off the south-west coast of Britain with a mirror and a sword. “Up to the Roman period, we only find mirrors in graves that we are comfortable saying were female,” says Pope. “We would tend to find swords in male graves.” The combination of the two intrigued archaeologists when they discovered the grave in 1999, but they had to wait almost a quarter of a century for aDNA analysis to show that the individual was biologically female. If her grave goods reflected her role in life, a team led by osteoarchaeologist Simon Mays of Historic England concluded, she may have been a high-ranking woman who participated in active combat.\nArchaeological remains have revealed that female Scythian warriors weren’t just the stuff of mythologyMichael Svetbird/Alamy\nArchaeological remains have revealed that female Scythian warriors weren’t just the stuff of mythology\nMichael Svetbird/Alamy\nShe and the Durotriges wouldn’t have been the first warrior women. There are graves of indisputably female fighters in what is now Armenia, south of the Caucasus, dating from 3000 years ago. On the steppes of Ukraine, Iron Age burials identified as Scythian include a woman interred with gold and silver treasure, arrows and her horse – hinting that the Amazons may not have been entirely mythical. Likewise, the Valkyries of Norse mythology find echoes in evidence of Viking women who charged into battle – notably the individual found in a grave at Birka, Sweden, along with weapons including a sword, axe, spear and battle knife, as well as two horses. Assumed for over a century to be a man, geneticists reassigned her in 2017.\nAs the discoveries stack up, researchers have been asking what other roles, usually attributed to men, might have been performed by women in the past – and finding that there was really no limit. In the earliest Mexican farming villages, women oversaw ceremonies involving communication with ancestors. The so-called Siberian Ice Maiden, whose tattooed body was buried in the Altai mountains of Central Asia around 2500 years ago, is thought to have been a high-ranking spiritual leader – a shaman. And women also performed shamanic rituals in pre-farming Europe.\nOther prehistoric women, meanwhile, overturned the long-held trope of “man the hunter, woman the gatherer”. One buried with hunting implements points to the presence of female big-game hunters in the Americas 9000 years ago. Millennia later, Indigenous women acted as trackers and guides to the first European fur traders in North America. Indeed, anthropologists Sarah Lacy at the University of Delaware and Cara Ocobock at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, make the case that women hunted throughout the Palaeolithic. In some ways, they say – notably a metabolism built for endurance – they were better adapted to the task than men.\nWho were the enigmatic Sea Peoples blamed for the Bronze Age collapse?Around 3000 years ago, several empires and kingdoms in the Mediterranean collapsed, with a group of sea-faring warriors implicated as the culprit.

Archaeologists who excavated his 5000-year-old remains in 2008 from a site near Seville, Spain, dubbed him the “Ivory Man” and suggested that he might have been the most important person on the Iberian peninsula in his lifetime. So it came as a shock when, 13 years later, analysis of proteins in his tooth enamel revealed that he wasn’t male at all. The Ivory Man was, in fact, the “Ivory Lady”.\nPerhaps this re-sexing shouldn’t have come as such a surprise. Of late, the ability to probe ancient biological remains has led to the discovery of prehistoric women in all sorts of unexpected places. It turns out they have occupied roles and positions that would have confounded 20th-century researchers. Whether in the form of Stone Age women spearing bison, Neolithic ones controlling the allocation of land, or the sensational case of a Viking warrior who, like the Ivory Lady, was belatedly identified as female, the new evidence is rocking our understanding of how ancient societies viewed gender roles.\nNobody is suggesting that women and men were treated as equals in the ancient world, much less that it was a feminist paradise. Indeed, man-centred societies were probably the norm. But enough exceptions have come to light to suggest a breathtaking variety of social organisation. “There’s no one idea of womanhood or masculinity,” says archaeologist Rachel Pope at the University of Liverpool, UK. “Instead, there’s real variation in social norms across time and space.” Finally, we are unearthing prehistory’s powerful women.\nRead moreThe remarkable tale of how humans nearly didn’t conquer the world\nRead more\nThe remarkable tale of how humans nearly didn’t conquer the world\nDespite huge leaps in equality over the past century, today’s societies are still largely patriarchal. Archaeologists have long been taught that this status quo got its foothold when farming became widespread, starting around 10,000 years ago. Hunter-gatherer groups are generally seen as egalitarian, albeit with men and women doing different types of work. But, the idea goes, as societies became more sedentary and began generating wealth in the form of surplus food, people started to attach importance to inheritance, and rules were established for transferring wealth from fathers to sons. With wealth came male power and female oppression. Or so argued Karl Marx’s collaborator, the political theorist Friedrich Engels, in the late 1800s. “That model supported a particular political system and was based on no archaeological evidence,” says Penny Bickle, archaeologist at the University of York, UK.\nA rival idea, put forward in the 1960s by Lithuanian archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, suggested that Europe’s oldest farming societies were woman-centric and thrived until 5000 years ago, when herders arrived from the steppes and imposed their patriarchal world view. It has, however, proved equally unfounded. These grand narratives, which invoke a single inflection point, no longer fit the data, says Bickle. The advent of new archaeological tools – notably the ability to analyse not only ancient DNA (aDNA), but also proteins and isotopes, or variants of elements consumed as food – reveal both ideas to be overly simplistic. “We shouldn’t be writing origin stories like these,” she says. Instead, what’s emerging is a more complex picture, showing how economic and historical context powerfully shaped the way men and women lived – and that societies were capable of flipping from one system to another within centuries, if conditions changed.\nSubscriber-only newsletter\nEach month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more.\nAnalysis of these societies also highlights the distinction between biological sex – including the ability to bear children – and gender, referring to our habit of assigning people distinct cultural attributes – masculine or feminine – based on their sex. Archaeologist Jennifer French at the University of Liverpool thinks that the concept of gender emerged with symbolic thinking, and that early Stone Age art and burial rites suggest the first modern humans were familiar with it, as were Neanderthals. Despite this, some researchers prefer to talk about “males” and “females” in that period, rather than “men” and “women”. “To me, it seems a little dehumanising,” she says.\nThe temple of the Egyptian ruler Hatshepsut remains a testament to one of the most powerful womenUwe Skrzypczak/imageBROKER.com/Alamy\nThe temple of the Egyptian ruler Hatshepsut remains a testament to one of the most powerful women\nUwe Skrzypczak/imageBROKER.com/Alamy\nNevertheless, the early Stone Age is largely a black box when it comes to gender roles. “Sexed burials with accompanying material culture, and iconographic artefacts, are either absent or rare,” says French. The tiny glimpses that archaeology and aDNA have afforded, combined with ethnographic evidence from modern or historical hunter-gatherer societies, hint that patrilocality and female exogamy were the norm. In other words, couples moved to live with the man’s family. However, because these groups tended to be small, they probably had to be adaptable, so matrilocal societies, where women stayed with their kin, may also sometimes have emerged.\nMatrilocal societies tend to give women greater participation in communal life, says anthropologist Carol Ember at Yale University, probably because, with family around, women are less likely to be defined exclusively as wives and mothers. This is especially true if resources – importantly, land – pass through the female line. And this matrilineal system of inheritance often goes together with matrilocality. According to a hypothesis developed by Ember and her husband Melvin Ember, who was also an anthropologist, matrilocality is most likely to emerge when women are the main workers in a subsistence economy – making it preferable that daughters stay at home – and when there is no threat of war, so families have no need to keep their sons close to help defend the household. This suggests that matrilocality would have been the exception in prehistory, because intergroup violence was so common. But there are other factors favouring women-centred societies, including situations where the paternity of children is uncertain and where groups have a history of migration.\nRead moreThe archaeologist fighting claims about an advanced lost civilisation\nRead more\nThe archaeologist fighting claims about an advanced lost civilisation\nThat covers the theory. On the ground, studying gender in prehistoric remains is complicated by the fact that how people were placed in burials may not reflect how they lived. Stable isotope analysis can help, by showing – through the detection of dietary changes – whether people died in the same place where they grew up. Genetics can help too, by revealing biological links among groups that recurred over generations and regions. Even then, interpreting the evidence can be tricky. Power maps onto patterns of post-marital residence and inheritance in different ways. Trickier still, says Pope, is that “there isn’t a demonstrable link between grave wealth and power”.\nA case in point is the early farming community that inhabited the 9000-year-old site of Çatalhöyük in modern Turkey. Archaeologists consider this group to have been egalitarian, in that men and women had similar diets and did similar kinds of work. But, in a new genetic study, Eren Yüncü at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara and her colleagues show that the society was matrilocal and that young women were accorded more lavish grave goods than men. This doesn’t necessarily mean that women pulled the strings at Çatalhöyük, however. “Grave goods often express the lost reproductive potential when young women die,” says archaeologist Katharina Rebay-Salisbury at the University of Vienna, Austria.\nExceptional though they have been, matrilocal or matrilineal societies have now been documented on every inhabited continent in the ancient world. The first humans to reach the remote islands of Oceania, around 3000 years ago, were matrilocal, according to a 2022 study led by geneticist Yue-Chen Liu at Harvard University. The earliest farming societies in Thailand probably were, too. And in 2017, geneticists detected a high-status matrilineal group that persisted for more than 300 years in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico – an important ritual and political centre in North America around the 10th century – whose modern descendants include the matrilineal Zuni and Hopi peoples.\nFu Hao, one of the wives of King Wu Ding of the Shang dynasty, was a military general and high priestessImaginechina Limited/Alamy\nFu Hao, one of the wives of King Wu Ding of the Shang dynasty, was a military general and high priestess\nImaginechina Limited/Alamy\nBut there is a paradox. “In the matrilocal, matrilineal societies that we have studied in the recent anthropological record, women were never political leaders,” says Ember. They had higher status and more influence than women in patrilocal, patrilineal societies, but they didn’t make the decisions. That was typically the preserve of their brothers, who were often more heavily invested in their sisters’ children than in their own. This prompts the question of what we mean by power. There are famous cases of women who took on the trappings of masculine-coded hard power, with an emphasis on physical strength and domination. The Egyptian pharaoh Hatshepsut, who reigned in the 15th century BC, sported kingly regalia, commissioned monuments and initiated at least one military campaign.

This step is known as exercising your options, and it can occur any time until the options expire, up to 10 years after the options are granted.\nThere are two kinds of stock options.\nIncentive stock options, or ISOs, can only be granted to employees and must meet certain statutory requirements. They have certain tax benefits[0]IRS. Topic no. 427, Stock options.View all sources.\nNon-qualified stock options, or NSOs, can be granted to non-employees, such as advisors or board directors. But they don’t enjoy the tax benefits of ISOs.\nConsider the key differences between RSUs and stock options.\nRestricted stock units (RSUs)\nStock options\nAre there upfront costs?\nNo. Employees receive shares once they vest.\nYes. Employees receive the right to purchase shares at a set price once they vest.\nWhat are the typical stages?\nGrant\nVesting\nTransfer\nSale\nGrant\nVesting\nExercise\nSale\nWhat is the value based on?\nThe market price. Because you don’t pay to acquire the shares, they’ll always have some value, unless the share price of your company goes to $0.\nThe bargain element — that is, the difference between the strike price and the market value of the shares at the time they’re exercised. Because you pay to acquire the shares, they’ll only have value if the strike price is lower than the market price.\nHow are they taxed?\nThe market value of the vested shares is taxed as ordinary income.\nYou may also be taxed on any capital gains when you sell.\nISOs: Taxes are deferred until you sell your shares, though you may face an alternative minimum tax at the time you exercise.\nIf you meet certain holding period requirements when you sell, any income is taxed at the typically lower capital gains tax rate.\nNSOs: The bargain element is taxed as ordinary income.\nYou may owe capital gains tax when you sell.\nWhen are taxes owed?\nWhen the shares vest. This means employees don’t have the ability to time the tax event.\nWhen you exercise your options. This means employees have some ability to time the tax event.\nDo they expire?\nNo. Any vested RSUs remain yours, even after you leave the company.\nYes. Options typically must be exercised within 10 years from the date they’re granted. When you leave a company, you may have to exercise any vested options within 90 days. In both cases, the actual time period may differ between companies.\nWhat’s the risk level?\nLower risk because they require no upfront cost and will retain their value.\nHigher risk because they require some upfront cost, could expire, and could lose all value if the market price is lower than the strike price.\nStock options and RSUs each have their advantages and disadvantages. But there could be circumstances in which one is more helpful than the other, says Messeca of Craftwork Capital.\nWhich might be better? RSUs\nWhy? RSUs follow predictable timelines and retain their value. “If I'm trying to fund education for my children, I know when an RSU vests, I have the net of those shares, I can sell them right away and pay for school or invest them in another fund,” Messeca says.\nWhich might be better? Stock options.\nWhy? Stock options generally are seen as a “high risk, high reward” incentive, Messeca says, which is why startups and other companies with high-growth potential might use them to attract top talent. “If I'm in the investor mindset and in good shape, doing everything I need to do, maybe I'm more willing to focus my efforts on options because my potential upside is very large there.”\nWhile the risk associated with RSUs and stock options may be a key factor to weigh, it’s not the only one. To assess whether RSUs or stock options might be best for you, Messeca recommends gathering the specific details of your plans, including:\nThe value of the company today. This can give you an idea of what your equity compensation might be worth. Though it’s important to keep in mind that the value likely will change during the vesting period.\nThe vesting schedule. You’ll want to know when you actually gain a right to the shares.\nHow readily you could sell the shares. In public companies, selling shares is pretty straightforward. But private companies might have additional stipulations or fewer opportunities to sell any stock you acquire. It could make the tax implications more or less attractive.\nAnd for options, specifically:\nThe strike price and how it compares to the current value.\nWhether it’s an ISO or NSO. That will affect how your shares would be taxed.\nWhether your company offers cashless exercising. Some companies permit employees to exercise their options without paying any upfront costs. Instead, the company is reimbursed out of the proceeds of the stock sale.\n» Need help?

The bombing targeted Al-Jaouni School in Al-Nuseirat Camp, amid expectations of an increase in the casualties.\nIn a related context, the Ministry of Health in Gaza announced on Wednesday that the Israeli occupation committed four massacres against civilians in the Strip during the past 24 hours, leaving 64 dead and 104 injured, raising the toll of the Israeli aggression on Gaza since 7 October to 41,084 dead and 95,029 injured.\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Ministry of Health indicated that 82.5% of the children (aged one day to ten years old) received the first dose of the polio vaccine. According to a statement by the ministry, the number of children who received the first dose was 527,776 children; 49% females and 51% males.\nThe Ministry of Health confirmed the continuation of the third round of the vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip and the North, noting that the teams of the Ministry, UNRWA, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF worked bravely in the vaccination campaign, despite the ongoing aggression on the Strip, and the great danger posed to their lives.\nIn another context, the Israeli occupation army announced that two soldiers were killed and seven others injured in a helicopter crash in the Salah Al-Din axis, south of the Gaza Strip. The army said that the helicopter crashed during a mission to transport an injured soldier.\nTo follow Daily News Egypt on WhatsApp press here\nTo follow Daily News Egypt on Telegram press here\nSign in to your account\nRemember me",

    "content": "The Israeli occupation forces committed Wednesday a new massacre in Al-Nuseirat Camp in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least nine civilians. The bombing targeted Al-Jaouni School in Al-Nuseirat Camp, amid expectations of an increase in the casualties.\nIn a related context, the Ministry of Health in Gaza announced on Wednesday that the Israeli occupation committed four massacres against civilians in the Strip during the past 24 hours, leaving 64 dead and 104 injured, raising the toll of the Israeli aggression on Gaza since 7 October to 41,084 dead and 95,029 injured.\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Ministry of Health indicated that 82.5% of the children (aged one day to ten years old) received the first dose of the polio vaccine. According to a statement by the ministry, the number of children who received the first dose was 527,776 children; 49% females and 51% males.\nThe Ministry of Health confirmed the continuation of the third round of the vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip and the North, noting that the teams of the Ministry, UNRWA, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF worked bravely in the vaccination campaign, despite the ongoing aggression on the Strip, and the great danger posed to their lives.\nIn another context, the Israeli occupation army announced that two soldiers were killed and seven others injured in a helicopter crash in the Salah Al-Din axis, south of the Gaza Strip. The army said that the helicopter crashed during a mission to transport an injured soldier.\nTo follow Daily News Egypt on WhatsApp press here\nTo follow Daily News Egypt on Telegram press here\nSign in to your account\nRemember me",

    "title": "At  250 million  top AI salaries dwarf those of th 20250804 052317",
    "content": "A 24 year-old AI researcher will earn 327x what Oppenheimer made while developing the atomic bomb.\nSilicon Valley's AI talent war just reached a compensation milestone that makes even the most legendary scientific achievements of the past look financially modest. When Meta recently offered AI researcher Matt Deitke $250 million over four years (an average of $62.5 million per year)—with potentially $100 million in the first year alone—it shattered every historical precedent for scientific and technical compensation we can find on record. That includes salaries during the development of major scientific milestones of the 20th century.\nThe New York Times reported that Deitke had cofounded a startup called Vercept and previously led the development of Molmo, a multimodal AI system, at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. His expertise in systems that juggle images, sounds, and text—exactly the kind of technology Meta wants to build—made him a prime target for recruitment. But he's not alone: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly also offered an unnamed AI engineer $1 billion in compensation to be paid out over several years. What's going on?\nThese astronomical sums reflect what tech companies believe is at stake: a race to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence—machines capable of performing intellectual tasks at or beyond the human level. Meta, Google, OpenAI, and others are betting that whoever achieves this breakthrough first could dominate markets worth trillions. Whether this vision is realistic or merely Silicon Valley hype, it's driving compensation to unprecedented levels.\nTo put these salaries in a historical perspective: J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project that ended World War II, earned approximately $10,000 per year in 1943. Adjusted for inflation using the US Government's CPI Inflation Calculator, that's about $190,865 in today's dollars—roughly what a senior software engineer makes today. The 24-year-old Deitke, who recently dropped out of a PhD program, will earn approximately 327 times what Oppenheimer made while developing the atomic bomb.\nMany top athletes can't compete with these numbers. The New York Times noted that Steph Curry's most recent four-year contract with the Golden State Warriors was $35 million less than Deitke's Meta deal (although soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo will make $275 million this year as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world).  The comparison prompted observers to call this an \"NBA-style\" talent market—except the AI researchers are making more than NBA stars.\nMark Zuckerberg recently told investors that Meta plans to continue throwing money at AI talent \"because we have conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do.\" In a recent open letter, he described superintelligent AI as technology that would \"begin an exciting new era of individual empowerment,\" despite declining to define what superintelligence actually is.\nThis vision explains why companies treat AI researchers like irreplaceable assets rather than well-compensated professionals. If these companies are correct, the first to achieve artificial general intelligence or superintelligence won't just have a better product—they'll have technology that could invent endless new products or automate away millions of knowledge-worker jobs and transform the global economy. The company that controls that kind of technology could become the richest company in history by far.\nSo perhaps it's not surprising that even the highest salaries of employees from the early tech era pale in comparison to today's AI researcher salaries. Thomas Watson Sr., IBM's legendary CEO, received $517,221 in 1941—the third-highest salary in America at the time (about $11.8 million in 2025 dollars). The modern AI researcher's package represents more than five times Watson's peak compensation, despite Watson building one of the 20th century's most dominant technology companies.\nThe contrast becomes even more stark when considering the collaborative nature of past scientific achievements. During Bell Labs' golden age of innovation—when researchers developed the transistor, information theory, and other foundational technologies—the lab's director made about 12 times what the lowest-paid worker earned.  Meanwhile, Claude Shannon, who created information theory at Bell Labs in 1948, worked on a standard professional salary while creating the mathematical foundation for all modern communication.\nThe \"Traitorous Eight\" who left William Shockley to found Fairchild Semiconductor—the company that essentially birthed Silicon Valley—split ownership of just 800 shares out of 1,325 total when they started. Their seed funding of $1.38 million (about $16.1 million today) for the entire company is a fraction of what a single AI researcher now commands.\nThe Apollo program offers another striking comparison. Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, earned about $27,000 annually—roughly $244,639 in today's money. His crewmates Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins made even less, earning the equivalent of $168,737 and $155,373, respectively, in today's dollars. Current NASA astronauts earn between $104,898 and $161,141 per year. Meta's AI researcher will make more in three days than Armstrong made in a year for taking \"one giant leap for mankind.\"\nThe engineers who designed the rockets and mission control systems for the Apollo program also earned modest salaries by modern standards. A 1970 NASA technical report provides a window into these earnings by analyzing salary data for the entire engineering profession. The report, which used data from the Engineering Manpower Commission, noted that these industry-wide salary curves corresponded directly to the government's General Schedule (GS) pay scale on which NASA's own employees were paid.\nAccording to a chart in the 1970 report, a newly graduated engineer in 1966 started with an annual salary of between $8,500 and $10,000 (about $84,622 to $99,555 today). A typical engineer with a decade of experience earned around $17,000 annually ($169,244 today). Even the most elite, top-performing engineers with 20 years of experience peaked at a salary of around $278,000 per year in today's dollars—a sum that a top AI researcher like Deitke can now earn in just a few days.\nCredit:\n\n                      \n          \n          Boris Zhitkov via Getty Images\nThis isn't the first time technical talent has commanded premium prices. In 2012, after three University of Toronto academics published AI research, they auctioned themselves to Google for $44 million (about $62.6 million in today's dollars). By 2014, a Microsoft executive was comparing AI researcher salaries to NFL quarterback contracts. But today's numbers dwarf even those precedents.\nSeveral factors explain this unprecedented compensation explosion. We're in a new realm of industrial wealth concentration unseen since the Gilded Age of the late 19th century. Unlike previous scientific endeavors, today's AI race features multiple companies with trillion-dollar valuations competing for an extremely limited talent pool. Only a small number of researchers have the specific expertise needed to work on the most capable AI systems, particularly in areas like multimodal AI, which Deitke specializes in. And AI hype is currently off the charts as \"the next big thing\" in technology.\nThe economics also differ fundamentally from past projects. The Manhattan Project cost $1.9 billion total (about $34.4 billion adjusted for inflation), while Meta alone plans to spend tens of billions annually on AI infrastructure. For a company approaching a $2 trillion market cap, the potential payoff from achieving AGI first dwarfs Deitke's compensation package.\nOne executive put it bluntly to The New York Times: \"If I'm Zuck and I'm spending $80 billion in one year on capital expenditures alone, is it worth kicking in another $5 billion or more to acquire a truly world-class team to bring the company to the next level? The answer is obviously yes.\"\nYoung researchers maintain private chat groups on Slack and Discord to share offer details and negotiation strategies. Some hire unofficial agents. Companies not only offer massive cash and stock packages but also computing resources—the NYT reported that some potential hires were told they would be allotted 30,000 GPUs, the specialized chips that power AI development.\nAlso, tech companies believe they're engaged in an arms race where the winner could reshape civilization. Unlike the Manhattan Project or Apollo program, which had specific, limited goals, the race for artificial general intelligence ostensibly has no ceiling. A machine that can match human intelligence could theoretically improve itself, creating what researchers call an \"intelligence explosion\" that could potentially offer cascading discoveries—if it actually comes to pass.\nWhether these companies are building humanity's ultimate labor replacement technology or merely chasing hype remains an open question, but we've certainly traveled a long way from the $8 per diem that Neil Armstrong received for his moon mission—about $70.51 in today's dollars—before deductions for the \"accommodations\" NASA provided on the spacecraft. After Deitke accepted Meta's offer, Vercept co-founder Kiana Ehsani joked on social media, \"We look forward to joining Matt on his private island next year.\"\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

You might own a dock, but that means you spent a lot of money on related real estate.

Another friend bought a 55-foot behemoth. It's a floating hotel, comfortable and luxurious. He hardly used it - and sold it at a big loss.\nSo my advice for people considering buying a boat are to recognise four key issues: knowledge, costs, skill and psychology. It looks like this:\n• Understand what you are getting into.\n• Carefully consider all of the costs of ownership.\n• Only buy what you can afford.\n• Make an intelligent decision about using your limited time and money.\nThis is a useful approach, more thoughtful than merely saying \"No!\" to anything with a price tag attached.

Consider assessing an investment:\n• Don't buy anything you don't understand.\n• Watch the fees on all of your funds, investments, advisers, etc.\n• Be smart about your own skill set in beating the market with stock selection or market timing; you are likely better off with an index fund instead.\n• Understand how markets behave, and only risk what you can tolerate going up and down with market volatility.\nWhenever I am stuck on a major decision, I try to run the issue through these four filters: knowledge, costs, skill and psychology.

    "title": "Browzwear snaps up Dutch AI fashion model startup  20250804 060451",
    "content": "The move marks a new chapter for AI avatars\nDutch startup Lalaland, a pioneer of AI-generated fashion models, has been snapped up by software firm Browzwear for an undisclosed sum.\nBased at TNW City in Amsterdam, Lalaland quickly made waves — and sparked debate — after launching its customisable, realistic AI avatars in 2019. They’re pitched as a way for brands to save money while showcasing more diversity in their advertisements.\nBrowzwear, best known for developing 3D design tools that let fashion brands prototype clothes without making physical samples, was already a Lalaland user before the acquisition. CEO Greg Hanson said the company is now bringing the Lalaland team fully “in-house.”\n“Our customers want absolute confidence in their digital twins,” he continued. “Lalaland’s hyper-realistic, diverse AI models supercharge that trust and dramatically cut the time between concept and commerce.”\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nSingapore-based Browzwear will integrate Lalaland’s AI team into its R&D division, where they’ll focus on improving the accuracy of virtual body shapes for better fit prediction.

They’re pitched as a way for brands to save money while showcasing more diversity in their advertisements.\nBrowzwear, best known for developing 3D design tools that let fashion brands prototype clothes without making physical samples, was already a Lalaland user before the acquisition. CEO Greg Hanson said the company is now bringing the Lalaland team fully “in-house.”\n“Our customers want absolute confidence in their digital twins,” he continued. “Lalaland’s hyper-realistic, diverse AI models supercharge that trust and dramatically cut the time between concept and commerce.”\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Wildfire Service reported Sunday that lightning continues to be a challenge in the province with 14,000 new strikes recorded the previous day. That beings the total number of strikes to 62,000 since Wednesday.\nLightning remains in the forecast for several parts of B.C., including the northeast, Robson Valley and the central and southeast, says the service, adding that winds are also expected to pick up in northern B.C.\nTemperatures, however, are expected to cool this week with scattered showers that will help firefighters’ efforts.\nAs of Sunday afternoon, there were 150 wildfires burning in B.C., including 35 started in the previous 24 hours, according to the wildfire service. In that same timeframe, there were 25 fires declared out.\n— Staff Reporter\nThe wildfire near Peachland that forced hundreds of residents to quickly evacuated their homes just days ago is no longer out of control and the evacuation order has been lifted for all residents.\nThe Central Okanagan Emergency Operations centre says the remaining 118 addresses on the last evacuation order are now cleared, and residents can return home but must be ready to leave again quickly.\nThe B.C. Wildfire service says the blaze is no longer out of control, and is now considered as being held after aerial firefighting efforts were effective in cooling the fire.\n—The Canadian Press\nAn evacuation order due to an out-of-control wildfire burning on Vancouver Island has been expanded to encompass nearly 400 properties, including an entire provincial park.\nThe fire burning on the north banks of Cameron Lake, about 60 kilometres from Nanaimo, grew to an estimated 2.45 square kilometres, officials said Saturday.\nDistrict spokeswoman Rebecca Taylor said most of the 393 properties under evacuation order are residential and that another 238 properties are under evacuation alert.\nLater in the day the evacuation order was expanded to the north and to the east\nA post on B.C. Parks website said an evacuation order was in place that includes all of Little Qualicum Falls Park.\n“To support the work of wildfire crews, all visitors should leave the park immediately and remain out of the area until further notice,” the advisory said.\nIt’s not immediately clear how many properties are affected by the order expansion.\nB.C. Wildfire Service said that since Wednesday, more than 48,000 lightning strikes have been recorded, with significant activity in the Kamloops, Cariboo and Prince George regions.\nThe Prince George Fire Centre alone reported more than 33,200 strikes.\nThe Saturday report said that 44 new wildfires have been detected in the last 24 hours, 34 of which are lightning-caused.\nThe number of active wildfires in B.C. continues to spike after high temperatures and lightning strikes this week\nThe wildfire service says the Cariboo Fire Centre region in central B.C. saw more than 1,200 lightning strikes Wednesday, which started 13 new fires in the area.\nThe Snaking River Wildfire, 65 kilometres west of Quesnel, is 1.5 square kilometres in size and producing smoke that is visible from Quesnel, Highway 97 and surrounding communities.\nHeat warnings have ended for much of the province and there’s a small chance of isolated showers, but dry conditions mean fuel on the ground remains ripe for ignition.\n—Tiffany Crawford, The Canadian Press\nThe Cantilever Bar wildfire located 10 kilometres south of Lytton had seen only limited growth on Saturday, according to the B.C. Wildfire Service.\nAn evacuation order for Lytton First Nation remains in place. Four areas also remain on evacuation alert.\nThe fire is highly visible from Highway 1, and fire officials are asking motorists to use extra caution and be aware of the surroundings while passing through.\nAn evacuation alert has been issued for some properties near Harrison Lake as the Bear Creek wildfire continues to burn out of control.\nThe Fraser Valley Regional District issued the alert Thursday for the North Cascade Bay Area on the east side of Harrison Lake.\nPeople who live in the affected area are asked to be prepared to leave their homes on short notice. “This is a cautionary notification as wildfire behaviour is not predictable,” said the regional district.\nIt said closures to the Harrison East Forest Service Road and other forest service roads might limit access to the area.\nThe evacuation alert includes the Cascade Peninsula Recreation site, which has 25 campsites on the eastern shore of the lake south of the wildfire.\nIt also covers about 50 cabins in the North Cascade Bay area.\nIf there were a weekend that could be described as peak summer in B.C., this would be it. Local vacation destinations see a surge of visitors as the cities empty out a little.\nBut with forest fires raging across the province, is it advisable to travel?\n“The August long weekend feels like the height of summer for us,” says Ellen Walker-Matthews, CEO of the Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association, where a wildfire is burning near Peachland. “We welcome people to continue with their plans.”\nThe patio at Bliss Bakery in Peachland was busy on Thursday, said owner Barry Yeo. Guests enjoyed baked goods and a water show as helicopters picked up buckets of water from the lake.\nThe bakery has a strong customer base, but business triples in the summer months, he said. “It should be business as usual this weekend,” he said.\nHarrison Hot Springs is also open despite a wildfire burning about 20 kilometres away on the eastern shore of Harrison Lake.\nRead the full story here.\n—Glenda Luymes\nWith files from Cheryl Chan and The Canadian Press\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Wildfire Service said that since Wednesday, more than 48,000 lightning strikes have been recorded, with significant activity in the Kamloops, Cariboo and Prince George regions.\nThe Prince George Fire Centre alone reported more than 33,200 strikes.\nThe Saturday report said that 44 new wildfires have been detected in the last 24 hours, 34 of which are lightning-caused.\nThe number of active wildfires in B.C. continues to spike after high temperatures and lightning strikes this week\nThe wildfire service says the Cariboo Fire Centre region in central B.C. saw more than 1,200 lightning strikes Wednesday, which started 13 new fires in the area.\nThe Snaking River Wildfire, 65 kilometres west of Quesnel, is 1.5 square kilometres in size and producing smoke that is visible from Quesnel, Highway 97 and surrounding communities.\nHeat warnings have ended for much of the province and there’s a small chance of isolated showers, but dry conditions mean fuel on the ground remains ripe for ignition.\n—Tiffany Crawford, The Canadian Press\nThe Cantilever Bar wildfire located 10 kilometres south of Lytton had seen only limited growth on Saturday, according to the B.C. Wildfire Service.\nAn evacuation order for Lytton First Nation remains in place. Four areas also remain on evacuation alert.\nThe fire is highly visible from Highway 1, and fire officials are asking motorists to use extra caution and be aware of the surroundings while passing through.\nAn evacuation alert has been issued for some properties near Harrison Lake as the Bear Creek wildfire continues to burn out of control.\nThe Fraser Valley Regional District issued the alert Thursday for the North Cascade Bay Area on the east side of Harrison Lake.\nPeople who live in the affected area are asked to be prepared to leave their homes on short notice. “This is a cautionary notification as wildfire behaviour is not predictable,” said the regional district.\nIt said closures to the Harrison East Forest Service Road and other forest service roads might limit access to the area.\nThe evacuation alert includes the Cascade Peninsula Recreation site, which has 25 campsites on the eastern shore of the lake south of the wildfire.\nIt also covers about 50 cabins in the North Cascade Bay area.\nIf there were a weekend that could be described as peak summer in B.C., this would be it. Local vacation destinations see a surge of visitors as the cities empty out a little.\nBut with forest fires raging across the province, is it advisable to travel?\n“The August long weekend feels like the height of summer for us,” says Ellen Walker-Matthews, CEO of the Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association, where a wildfire is burning near Peachland. “We welcome people to continue with their plans.”\nThe patio at Bliss Bakery in Peachland was busy on Thursday, said owner Barry Yeo. Guests enjoyed baked goods and a water show as helicopters picked up buckets of water from the lake.\nThe bakery has a strong customer base, but business triples in the summer months, he said. “It should be business as usual this weekend,” he said.\nHarrison Hot Springs is also open despite a wildfire burning about 20 kilometres away on the eastern shore of Harrison Lake.\nRead the full story here.\n—Glenda Luymes\nWith files from Cheryl Chan and The Canadian Press\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

    "title": "Canada Slaps Higher Tariffs on Chinese Steel  Beij 20250804 061538",
    "content": "Sohrab Darabshaw | Posted on July 29, 2025 |\nCanada has joined the growing list of countries imposing tariffs on steel imports from China. Late last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney unveiled a comprehensive strategy to curb the influx of low-cost steel into Canada, with a focus on Chinese material. Like other countries, the main reason for the steel tariffs is to shield the domestic Canadian industry from global market distortions triggered by U.S. protectionism.\nCanada already has 25% tariffs in place on steel and aluminum imported from China. Under the new strategy, the country has also decided to target Chinese steel manufactured in other countries. This is significant, as China was Canada’s second-largest trading partner in 2024, with bilateral trade totaling C$120 billion. The decision to implement the additional steel tariffs has drawn swift condemnation from Beijing, which accused Ottawa of violating international trade norms.\nEnd the steel volatility game with weekly guidance that helps you plan, budget, and negotiate better using MetalMiner’s newsletter.\nThe main points of the new strategy are as follows:\nCanada has blamed the disruptive impact of President Trump’s 50% U.S. steel tariffs for redirecting global steel flows into Canada. In fact, Mr. Carney claimed early on that his country would be one of the countries most impacted by these developments. According to an Industry Canada report cited by the Global Times, Canada imported over $16 billion in steel in 2024, of which approximately 50% came from the U.S. and about 10% from China.\nWant to make every data dollar count? MetalMiner Select allows you to stop paying for unnecessary price points, focusing your investment on steel data that drives informed purchasing decisions.\nAccording to the New York Times, Canada is set to tighten its trade controls by restricting steel imports from China and other countries impacted by recent U.S. tariffs. The move is designed to stabilize domestic markets and protect Canadian manufacturers from a surge of redirected, low-cost steel. As steel remains a cornerstone of Canada’s industrial base, officials cautioned that price volatility and production strain could escalate if corrective measures aren’t taken.\nCanada has now joined the list of other countries that have imposed similar tariffs on Chinese steel since 2024. In early 2025, the U.S. raised cumulative tariffs to 70%. Meanwhile, Vietnam imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel earlier this year. Other nations that have taken steps regarding steel tariffs include South Korea, Mexico and the European Union.\nAs MetalMiner has reported for years, China’s massive steel export volumes, which reached as high as 110 million tons in 2024, are driven by a combination of domestic economic shifts and strategic global positioning. Meanwhile, some of the main reasons why China is not really consuming its own steel are a lack of demand following a slump in real estate demand and a slowdown in industrial production.\nAs per this Reuters report, both China’s Ministry of Commerce and its embassy in Ottawa issued strongly worded statements regarding the new steel tariffs. For starters, the Chinese have accused Canada of violating World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and disrupting the global trade order. They have also warned of countermeasures to protect Chinese firms’ interests, calling the tariffs “unjustified, legally baseless, and ineffective.”\nAccording to media reports, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce stated that Canada’s steel industry is facing problems due to the unilateral tariff measures implemented by the United States. However, rather than facing up to that issue, the Canadian government is attempting to shift the damage onto other trading partners, such as China. They added that the move would harm bilateral economic ties.\nMetalMiner’s solutions are your key to steel risk-mitigating strategies, view our full catalog of covered steel types and forms.\nDespite the reaction by Chinese officials, the Canadian Government’s move has been received positively by steel firms across Canada. The Canadian Steel Producers Association welcomed the additional tariff.\nTo cushion the impact on workers, Ottawa also announced $70 million in training and income support for up to 10,000 steelworkers. It will also inject $1 billion into the Strategic Innovation Fund for modernization and sustainability\nIncidentally, it was only last year that Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, after which China imposed tariffs on Canadian agricultural and seafood products. As trade talks with the U.S. intensify ahead of the August 1 deadline, the Canadian PM acknowledged that some form of tariff in any deal was likely unavoidable.\nFiled under: Carbon Steel, Commodities, Exports, Ferrous Metals, Imports, Tariffs\nAluminum\nAluminum MMI\naluminum price\nanti-dumping\nArcelorMittal\nAutomotive\nAutomotive MMI\nChina\nCobalt\nConstruction MMI\nCopper\ncopper MMI\ncopper price\ncopper prices\nGeneral Motors\nGold\nimports\nIndia\nIron Ore\nL1\nL9\nLME\nnickel\nNorsk Hydro\nOil\nrare earths\nrare earths MMI\nraw steels MMI\nRenewables MMI\nRio Tinto\nSection 232\nStainless MMI\nStainless Steel\nstainless steel price\nSteel\nsteel imports\nsteel price\nsteel prices\nsteel production\ntariffs\nTata Steel\nU.S.-China trade talks\nU.S. Steel\nWeek In Review\nZinc\nMetalMiner helps buying organizations better manage margins, smooth commodity volatility, generate cost savings and negotiate prices for metal commodities.

    "content": "Sohrab Darabshaw | Posted on July 28, 2025 |\nIn the end, China exceeded market expectations, posting a 5.2% year-on-year growth on July 14 compared to the market forecast of 5%. According to the economic data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, strong trade and industrial production helped to propel growth, indicating that China has braved the tariff war unleashed by the United States. Meanwhile declining steel prices seem to indicate further trouble in the property market.\nWant to enhance your steel market intelligence? Subscribe to MetalMiner’s Monthly Metals Index Report to gain a deep understanding of the dynamics affecting steel prices and markets, along with seven other metal industries.\nIt was this very expectation of a 5% growth in Q2 that iron ore traders were banking on. In the days leading up to the release of the Q2 data, iron ore wrangled its biggest weekly gain since January this year. This came as presumptuous traders bet on the positive reporting of the second-quarter economic growth by the world’s largest metals-consuming nation.\nLast Monday, the future prices of this steel raw material rose to as high as $99.90 a ton after surging 3.6% the previous week. Following the biggest gain in recent months, the ore futures market continued to rally. Singapore iron futures hovered near the US $99.30 ton mark while the yuan-dominated contracts on the Dalian exchange advanced. This contrasted with a decline in steel futures on the Shanghai markets.\nThe script was slightly different when markets opened on Tuesday. Following the release of China’s economic growth data, markets saw a significant dip. As weak property sector data from China dented market sentiment, benchmark 62% iron ore futures fell. Futures on the Singapore Exchange dropped toward $105 per tonne, with Dalian prices also retreating.\nBy the end of Tuesday trading, iron ore futures had fallen by 1.6%, indicating slowing demand from steel companies. In Singapore, ore price settled at US $98.92 per ton, down by 0.7%. Meanwhile, according to this report, Dalian (yuan-based) and Shanghai (steel contracts) also reported a decline in futures rates.\nTurn steel market jitters into cost-saving opportunities. Subscribe to MetalMiner’s newsletter.\nAs revealed in the new set of economic data, declining steel prices could be a direct fallout of sharper-than-expected slowdowns in fixed-asset investment, retail sales and falling property prices. In June, new home prices in China fell for a 12th consecutive month. There’s also concern that a slowdown could be on the way, even though Beijing claims its economy is on track.\nIncidentally, much of the rally in iron ore futures last week was due to anticipation that China would announce schemes to boost the ailing property sector and counter industrial overcapacity. While the former did not happen, the data released contained some indication that the latter may still be in the works.\nGoing forward, analysts say iron ore gains are narrowing as traders grow cautious amid high prices, which they expect to hover between $95–100/ton in the short term. Meanwhile, some primary market drivers include continued resilient demand from Chinese steel mills despite production cuts, declining sea shipments from Australia and Brazil, trader optimism and port inventories continuing to fall, indicating strong consumption.\nAccording to this report, June steel production decreased 9.2% year-over-year to 83.2 million tons, marking the largest monthly decline in 10 months. China’s economic growth eased slightly in Q2 2025, registering a year-on-year expansion of 5.2%, a decline from 5.4% in Q1. Despite the moderation, the second-quarter performance surpassed market consensus, even after analysts raised forecasts in May.\nFor the first half of the year, China’s GDP rose by 5.3% YoY, keeping the country on course to meet its “around 5%” growth target for 2025. Nevertheless, first half output is now at its weakest since 2020, 3% below last year’s pace. For now, Beijing appears ready to continue its efforts to curb oversupply in key industrial commodities, and the data released suggests continued pressure on the construction and manufacturing sectors amid a broader economic slowdown.\nLooking ahead, the second half of 2025 presents new headwinds for China’s economic growth, which is obviously going to affect iron ore costs, steel prices and more. This analysis suggests that tariff-related uncertainty remains a significant overhang, particularly as critical deadlines approach in August. While a return to April’s peak tariffs seems unlikely, further escalations can’t be ruled out. This would potentially suppress investment and weigh on business confidence.\nAdditionally, momentum from trade-in subsidies may start to taper unless policies are further extended. Efforts to tackle China’s “involution”—excessive price competition—could deliver long-term gains, but not without near-term economic friction.\nDespite these challenges, the solid first-half showing leaves China well-positioned to meet its full-year growth target .According to the report by the research team at ING, current risks to the 4.7% YoY GDP forecast appear broadly balanced, with some upside potential,\nDo you know which steel contracting mechanisms are best with different market conditions?

    "title": "Can Europe s AI rules turn worker protections into 20250804 060451",
    "content": "As artificial intelligence threatens jobs across Europe, lawmakers face pressure to amend the AI Act\nWhile the US has largely pursued AI development with minimal regulatory oversight, Europe has taken a markedly different approach. The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.\nA recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas. With studies finding that one in four jobs are at risk of being transformed by AI globally, the impact in Europe — a region which faces a significant shortage of skilled workers — has become a pressing concern.\n“In many ways, it’s too early to tell where the AI wave will take us — we’ve only seen a fraction of its capabilities so far, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying,” Adam Maurer, COO at Connecting Software, a tech company operating across Europe, told TNW.\nIn recent years, Big Tech companies have frequently carried out mass layoffs, driven both by revenue concerns and the belief that AI can take over many of the functions of employees from entry to mid-level, Maurer said.\nSome of these AI-driven layoffs have effectively targeted low performers, but other initiatives have been problematic. At Klarna, for example, they had concerning impacts on the business.\nKlarna, a Swedish fintech company that fired 700 workers and replaced them with AI, recently announced it will hire humans back again. The company’s CEO admitted to having made a “mistake” when replacing workers with AI.\n“It’s very clear that AI will definitely replace some jobs,” Maurer said. “On the other side of the coin, I think it will make some other jobs far more valuable.”\nIn the EU, labour laws and regulations will shape the impact on jobs. Tech leaders believe they could lead to an AI future that benefits both workers and businesses.\nMaurer said there may be some expectation for the EU to step in and regulate job displacement. However, he argued that would stagnate growth and discourage startups from doing business in the union.\nBut not every business leader agrees. Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.\n“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.\nKubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.\n“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.\nRoman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.\n“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”\nWill the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?\nKris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.\nAmending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.\nA token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.\n“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.\nEuropean labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.\nAhead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.\nThe previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.\nWe asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.\n“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”\nUnions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”\nDespite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.\nKubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.\n“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”\nKubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”\nJorge Rieto, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.\nJones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.\nHe believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.\n“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.\nEurope is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.\nMahesh Raja, CEO of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.\nHowever, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.\n”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.\n“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”\nRay Fernandez is a journalist with over a decade of experience reporting on technology, finance, science, and natural resources.

Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.\n“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.\nKubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.\n“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.\nRoman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.\n“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”\nWill the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?\nKris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.\nAmending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.\nA token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.\n“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.\nEuropean labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.\nAhead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.\nThe previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.\nWe asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.\n“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”\nUnions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”\nDespite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.\nKubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.\n“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”\nKubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”\nJorge Rieto, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.\nJones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.\nHe believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.\n“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.\nEurope is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.\nMahesh Raja, CEO of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.\nHowever, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.\n”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.\n“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”\nRay Fernandez is a journalist with over a decade of experience reporting on technology, finance, science, and natural resources.

Innovent, founded in 2011, was one of the first batch of firms to go public in 2018 under a Hong Kong listing regime that allowed drug and medical device developers with no profit or revenue to sell shares.\nIn the second half, Zhang estimated that Innovent would book 1 billion yuan in sales from mazdutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) weight loss drug launched in July.\nThat would amount to a sixth of the company’s total expected revenue for this year, making it a key contributor to the improved bottom line. Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide, the first GLP-1 drug launched in China last year for weight loss, generated revenue of 770 million yuan in the first quarter.",

    "title": "Dominion still has pending lawsuits against electi 20250804 060353",
    "content": "Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest US media news here or read about today’s settlement in the updates below.\nIn a statement made Tuesday after Fox News settled the defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems, Fox said:\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.”\nSo, what did those rulings say?\nThis is about the topic of falsity. To win a defamation case, you need to prove a few things. Most importantly, you need to prove the statements were false and that they were made with actual malice, otherwise known as a reckless disregard for the truth.\nIn a major pretrial ruling on March 31, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled Dominion had successfully proven that all 20 statements mentioned in its lawsuit against Fox were false.\n“Through its extensive proof, Dominion has met its burden of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact as to falsity… The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” Davis wrote.\nDominion Voting Systems’ co-lead counsel Justin Nelson said he and Dominion’s other attorneys were expecting to go to trial against Fox News on Tuesday.\nThe final deal to settle the case with the right-wing network for $787.5 million came late in the day, and the settlement papers with Fox were signed just “minutes” before the agreement was announced, he said.\nPrior to the last-minute settlement, Nelson told CNN he and other attorneys had been preparing opening statements – even during the two-and-a-half-hour courtroom delay after the lunch recess.\nFox News will pay more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems after lawyers from both sides hammered out a last-minute settlement of the defamation case launched against the right-wing network.\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\nCNN’s Bill Hennessy, court sketch artist, captured scenes from inside the courtroom:\nDominion Voting Systems had two goals in its defamation case against Fox News — accountability and “trying to make Dominion whole,” said Justin Nelson, the lead counsel election technology company.\nBoth were accomplished in this settlement, he told CNN on Tuesday.\nThe payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network’s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client’s company.\n“This is really the first time that anyone has paid a price for telling the lies of the 2020 election and we’re very proud about that,” he said.\nWhile the settlement does not stipulate that Fox’s anchors must acknowledge the lies on air, Nelson said it was a consequential outcome for the network.\nThe texts and emails that emerged during the litigation process from inside the Fox network were valuable, he said. “And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you’re telling lies.”\nPrevious court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air.\n“It’s a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually there’s going to be consequences to that,” Nelson said.\nHe said the settlement with Fox sends a “strong message” to other right-wing outlets in which Dominion has ongoing legal disputes.\nFox News’ payment of $787.5 million to Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\nNotably, in 2017, ABC News paid $177 million after its years-long legal dispute with South Dakota-based meat processor Beef Products Inc. over its textured meat product that the network referred to as “pink slime.”\nAt the time, the settlement was believed to be the biggest amount ever paid in a media defamation case in the United States.\nFox News anchors will not have to acknowledge on-air that it told election lies about Dominion Voting Systems as part of the terms of its settlement, a representative for the election technology company told CNN.\nFox News did acknowledge in its statement that falsehoods were broadcast.\nBut top anchors at the right-wing talk channel will not be required as part of the settlement to acknowledge on air the lies broadcast in the wake of the 2020 election.\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion,”  said the company CEO John Poulos on Tuesday, following the last-minute $787.5 million settlement with the right-wing network.\n“Fox and Dominion have reached a historic settlement. Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my Company, our employees, and our customers. Nothing can ever make up for that,” Poulos said in the statement. “Throughout this process, we have sought accountability and believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading and endorsing lies.”\nSmartmatic, the voting technology company that is suing Fox News for $2.7 billion for defamation said its pending case will further expose wrongdoing by the right-wing network, following the last-minute settlement in the case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.\n“Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy,” said a statement from Smartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly.\nThe settlement for more than $787 million with Fox News represents “a ringing endorsement for truth and accountability,” the attorney representing Dominion Voting Systems said Tuesday.\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” said Justin Nelson of the Susman Godfrey law firm at a news conference outside the courthouse.\nNelson said that more than two years ago a “torrent of lies” had swept Dominion and election officials across America, causing “grievous harm to Dominion and the country.”\nNelson also said the country must “remain ever vigilant to find common ground.”\n“For our democracy to endure for another 250 years and, hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts,” Nelson added.\nThe $787.5 million settlement in the Fox-Dominion case is an unequivocal rebuke of the right-wing news network and its journalism, said Elie Honig, former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n“Translated it means we got caught lying by the judge – and I think that’s exactly why we are seeing this absolutely jaw-dropping number,” Honig told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\nAlthough the amount is about half of what Dominion was asking for, it’s still an astonishing sum, he said.\n“I didn’t think there was any way they would get $1.6 billion – even when they proved their case, even if they proved it overwhelmingly to a jury. Let’s remember, by its own estimation, Dominion valued the entire company at somewhere between $30 and $80 million. This settlement is 10 times the value of Dominion as an entire company. That’s how strong a statement this is with this number,” Honig explained.\nDominion Voting Systems still has pending lawsuits against right-wing networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell.\nAll of these parties and entities deny wrongdoing and are fighting the lawsuits.\nFollowing the announcement of a $787.5 million dollar settlement in the Fox News-Dominion case, John Poulos, the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems, said Fox News “admitted to telling lies” about the company.\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Poulos said.\n“Nothing can ever make up for that,” Poulos added at a news conference following court.\n“I cannot thank the election officials that we serve enough. Without them, there is no democracy,” he said.\nFox News has issued a statement on its settlement with Dominion Voting Systems acknowledging that some of the right-wing network’s on-air statements about Dominion were false.\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said.\nFor context: The statement was referring to Judge Eric Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\nThe settlement between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems totals $787,500,000, according to Dominion attorney Justin Nelson.\nThe settlement represents “vindication and accountability,” Nelson said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon.\n“The truth matters, lies have consequences,” Nelson said\n“Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm,” Nelson added.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis praised both sides after they abruptly settled the defamation case between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems at the last second.\nHe said, “I have been on the bench since 2010… I think this is the best lawyering I’ve had, ever.”\n“I would be proud to be your judge in the future,” Davis said, his final words before leaving the bench.\nThe hearing is now over. The case is now over.\nA last-second settlement has been reached in Dominion Voting Systems’ historic defamation lawsuit against Fox News, the parties announced Tuesday in court.\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said.  “Your presence here… was extremely important. And without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation,” the judge told the jurors, before dismissing them.\nThe settlement was apparently brokered while the trial was on the brink of opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware.\nAfter swearing in the jury earlier Tuesday, an unexplained hours-long delay paused proceedings in court, which yet again triggered rampant speculation that a deal was quietly in the works.\nWhat this means: The last-minute deal means the closely watched case is effectively over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\nDetails of the settlement were not immediately available and might never become public.\nMore on the case: In its lawsuit, Dominion sought $1.6 billion in damages from Fox News. The right-wing network argued vociferously in pretrial proceedings that this number was inflated and didn’t come close to accurately capturing the potential losses that Dominion could have suffered as a result of Fox’s 2020 broadcasts.\nFox News and Fox Corporation — its parent company, which was also a defendant — say they never defamed Dominion, and say the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. They denied Dominion’s claim that they promoted these election conspiracies to save their falling ratings after the 2020 election.\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was smeared on Fox shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.\nThe Fox-Dominion trial has resumed, after an unexplained delay of more than two hours.\nThe unexplained delay in the Fox News-Dominion defamation trial has surpassed 90 minutes.\nMoments ago in court, CNN observed a top Fox lawyer showing a piece of paper —presumably a note — to a top Dominion lawyer.\nA few minutes later, they both stepped out of the courtroom, into a private, secured area for court staff. Moments later, they walked back into court together. It is not known what they privately discussed, if anything.\nThe lawyers — Fox attorney Dan Webb and Dominion attorney Justin Nelson —subsequently huddled at Dominion’s table for a few minutes, in public view. They were talking to each other, but it is not known what they are saying.\nBoth men are now sitting at their respective tables, looking at their phones.\nThis comes ahead of the expected opening statements in the $1.6 billion defamation trial against Fox News.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has formally named a special master to investigate whether Fox News withheld evidence from Dominion Voting Systems, according to court filings.\nCNN reported last week that the judge was likely to launch this inquiry, which revolves around whether Fox intentionally suppressed evidence that it was legally obligated to provide to Dominion. The dispute escalated after audiotapes emerged of Fox host Maria Bartiromo talking to Rudy Giuliani in 2020.\n“The investigation should include a determination whether Fox News Network, LLC and Fox Corporation complied with their discovery obligations,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis wrote.\nThe order, which was posted on the docket earlier in the day as jury selection began in the trial, directed attorney John Elzufon to lead the inquiry. Elzufon previously served as special master to handle routine evidentiary issues in the case.\nElzufon is required to finish his probe and submit a report by May 15.\nThe judge’s order indicates that the special master has the power to take depositions as part of his inquiry – and the special master will be allowed to depose anyone he thinks is appropriate.\nFox is required to pay for all expenses related to the investigation, according to Davis’ order.\nFox lawyers say they never withheld anything from Dominion, and that when new evidence emerged at a late stage, they turned it over as quickly as possible.\nThe court in the Dominion-Fox defamation trial reconvened as planned at 1:30 p.m. ET in Wilmington, Delaware, after a lunch break, but there has been an unexplained slowdown in the proceedings.\nThe trial has not yet moved to opening statements, though that is expected next.\nLawyers for both sides have been present in the courtroom since things reconvened about one hour ago.\nThey have been looking at their phones, talking among their colleagues and waiting.\nThe jury is not inside the courtroom.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "content": "Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest US media news here or read about today’s settlement in the updates below.\nIn a statement made Tuesday after Fox News settled the defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems, Fox said:\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.”\nSo, what did those rulings say?\nThis is about the topic of falsity. To win a defamation case, you need to prove a few things. Most importantly, you need to prove the statements were false and that they were made with actual malice, otherwise known as a reckless disregard for the truth.\nIn a major pretrial ruling on March 31, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled Dominion had successfully proven that all 20 statements mentioned in its lawsuit against Fox were false.\n“Through its extensive proof, Dominion has met its burden of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact as to falsity… The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” Davis wrote.\nDominion Voting Systems’ co-lead counsel Justin Nelson said he and Dominion’s other attorneys were expecting to go to trial against Fox News on Tuesday.\nThe final deal to settle the case with the right-wing network for $787.5 million came late in the day, and the settlement papers with Fox were signed just “minutes” before the agreement was announced, he said.\nPrior to the last-minute settlement, Nelson told CNN he and other attorneys had been preparing opening statements – even during the two-and-a-half-hour courtroom delay after the lunch recess.\nFox News will pay more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems after lawyers from both sides hammered out a last-minute settlement of the defamation case launched against the right-wing network.\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\nCNN’s Bill Hennessy, court sketch artist, captured scenes from inside the courtroom:\nDominion Voting Systems had two goals in its defamation case against Fox News — accountability and “trying to make Dominion whole,” said Justin Nelson, the lead counsel election technology company.\nBoth were accomplished in this settlement, he told CNN on Tuesday.\nThe payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network’s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client’s company.\n“This is really the first time that anyone has paid a price for telling the lies of the 2020 election and we’re very proud about that,” he said.\nWhile the settlement does not stipulate that Fox’s anchors must acknowledge the lies on air, Nelson said it was a consequential outcome for the network.\nThe texts and emails that emerged during the litigation process from inside the Fox network were valuable, he said. “And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you’re telling lies.”\nPrevious court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air.\n“It’s a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually there’s going to be consequences to that,” Nelson said.\nHe said the settlement with Fox sends a “strong message” to other right-wing outlets in which Dominion has ongoing legal disputes.\nFox News’ payment of $787.5 million to Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\nNotably, in 2017, ABC News paid $177 million after its years-long legal dispute with South Dakota-based meat processor Beef Products Inc. over its textured meat product that the network referred to as “pink slime.”\nAt the time, the settlement was believed to be the biggest amount ever paid in a media defamation case in the United States.\nFox News anchors will not have to acknowledge on-air that it told election lies about Dominion Voting Systems as part of the terms of its settlement, a representative for the election technology company told CNN.\nFox News did acknowledge in its statement that falsehoods were broadcast.\nBut top anchors at the right-wing talk channel will not be required as part of the settlement to acknowledge on air the lies broadcast in the wake of the 2020 election.\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion,”  said the company CEO John Poulos on Tuesday, following the last-minute $787.5 million settlement with the right-wing network.\n“Fox and Dominion have reached a historic settlement. Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my Company, our employees, and our customers. Nothing can ever make up for that,” Poulos said in the statement. “Throughout this process, we have sought accountability and believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading and endorsing lies.”\nSmartmatic, the voting technology company that is suing Fox News for $2.7 billion for defamation said its pending case will further expose wrongdoing by the right-wing network, following the last-minute settlement in the case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.\n“Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy,” said a statement from Smartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly.\nThe settlement for more than $787 million with Fox News represents “a ringing endorsement for truth and accountability,” the attorney representing Dominion Voting Systems said Tuesday.\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” said Justin Nelson of the Susman Godfrey law firm at a news conference outside the courthouse.\nNelson said that more than two years ago a “torrent of lies” had swept Dominion and election officials across America, causing “grievous harm to Dominion and the country.”\nNelson also said the country must “remain ever vigilant to find common ground.”\n“For our democracy to endure for another 250 years and, hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts,” Nelson added.\nThe $787.5 million settlement in the Fox-Dominion case is an unequivocal rebuke of the right-wing news network and its journalism, said Elie Honig, former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n“Translated it means we got caught lying by the judge – and I think that’s exactly why we are seeing this absolutely jaw-dropping number,” Honig told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\nAlthough the amount is about half of what Dominion was asking for, it’s still an astonishing sum, he said.\n“I didn’t think there was any way they would get $1.6 billion – even when they proved their case, even if they proved it overwhelmingly to a jury.

    "content": "The ether (ETH) market is at a critical juncture as a whale snapped up ether (ETH) worth millions, positioning itself bullishly against the cryptocurrency's first weekly loss in over a month.\nProgrammable blockchain Ethereum's native token, ether, has dropped nearly 10% this week, hitting lows under $3,400 at one point, CoinDesk data show. The decline follows a robust five-week winning streak, signaling profit-taking or de-leveraging alongside losses on Wall Street.\nThe bearishness, however, contrasts with a powerful signal of long-term conviction from a whale. According to on-chain data tracked by Arkham Intelligence, a single entity snapped up a massive $300 million worth of ether as prices fell, executing a major \"buy the dip\" operation.\nIt's the case of bullish divergence. While the weekly price action suggests a loss of immediate upward momentum and potential profit-taking, the significant whale purchase indicates a belief that the recent downturn is merely a temporary setback.\nThe message is clear: As the price drop flushes out weaker hands, the process if being met with determined buying from a high-conviction entity.\nA fresh bout of macro jitters, sparked by the buoyant U.S. dollar and Friday's disappointing U.S. jobs data, has put the crypto market on the back foot.\nBitcoin, the largest digital asset by market value, has held relatively resilient, down just 4.5% for the week. BTC's outperformance relative ETH confirms the change in market sentiment sentiment against ETH that was first signaled by the options market.\nOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor and analyst on CoinDesk's Markets team.

Learn More\nKey Points\nExxon's second-quarter results led the sector.\nExxonMobil (XOM -1.96%) is in a class of its own. The oil company recently reported its second-quarter financial results, which led the sector across most key categories.\nThe company is in an excellent position to continue delivering leading results going forward, making it a compelling oil stock to buy and hold for the long term.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nExxonMobil earned $7.1 billion and generated $11.5 billion in cash flow from operations in the second quarter. That led all international oil companies (IOCs) by a wide margin. Exxon's earnings were more than double Chevron's ($3.1 billion) and well ahead of Shell's ($4.3 billion).\n\"The second quarter, once again, proved the value of our strategy and competitive advantages, which continue to deliver for our shareholders no matter the market conditions or geopolitical developments,\" stated CEO Darren Woods in the second-quarter earnings release. The oil giant delivered its highest second-quarter production total since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than a quarter century ago at 4.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day.\nIts output rose 13%, fueled mainly by its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. Additionally, Exxon reported the best quarter yet for high-value product sales in its products solution segment.\nAnother factor fueling Exxon's strong financial results is its structural cost savings program. The company has delivered $1.4 billion of savings this year, increasing its total to $13.5 billion since 2019. That's more than all other IOCs combined.\nExxon's strong cash flows enabled it to return an industry-leading $9.2 billion to its shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchases, leading the oil sector. It's on track to buy back $20 billion of its stock this year. Since May 2024, Exxon has already purchased about 40% of the shares it issued to buy Pioneer Natural Resources. Even with those lofty cash returns, Exxon maintained its sector-leading balance sheet featuring the industry's lowest leverage ratio, at 8% net debt to capital.\nExxon has commenced operations on six key projects this year and expects to start up four more by year-end. \"Collectively, these projects are expected to improve our earnings power by more than $3 billion in 2026 at constant prices and margins,\" commented CEO Darren Woods in the second-quarter earnings press release.\nThose projects are only the beginning. Exxon's plan to 2030 has it on pace to invest $140 billion in major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program over the next five years. Exxon also aims to deliver a total of $18 billion in structural cost savings by the end of 2030.\nThe company estimates that this plan will provide it with incremental growth potential of $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by 2030. That positions it to deliver compound annual growth rates of 10% for earnings and 8% for cash flow over the next several years.\nThe oil giant's plan would produce a staggering $165 billion in cumulative surplus cash over the next five years. That will provide Exxon with ample funds to continue increasing its dividend (a sector-leading 42 consecutive years) and repurchasing a substantial amount of stock. (It plans to repurchase $20 billion annually in 2025 and 2026.)\nExxonMobil is the undisputed leader in the oil sector, as evidenced by its industry-leading financial results in the second quarter. This allowed it to return more cash to investors than peers while maintaining the sector's top balance sheet.\nThe oil giant isn't likely to give up its leadership position anytime soon. Its plan up to 2030 would see it deliver meaningful earnings and cash flow growth over the next few years, allowing it to continue returning lots of money to investors. That combination of growth and cash returns positions Exxon to continue delivering peer-leading total return, which it has done over the past five years with its impressive 25% compound annual total return.\nMatt DiLallo is a contributing Motley Fool Stock Market Analyst specializing in covering publicly traded companies that pay dividends, especially those in the energy and REIT sectors.

    "content": "Niece of Agnes Wanjiru says she thinks John Healey is ‘taking us for a ride’\nThe niece of a Kenyan woman who was murdered more than a decade ago, allegedly by British soldiers, has said her family now believe the defence secretary “just made a promise for his political gain” when he met them in April.\nJohn Healey told the family of Agnes Wanjiru of his “determination to see a resolution” in the case of her murder, pledging the UK’s full support for the investigation.\nBut now, almost four months later, Wanjiru’s family say they have been left disappointed, having seen no further progress in their fight for justice.\nWanjiru, then 21, disappeared in March 2012, after last being seen drinking with British soldiers at a bar in the Lion’s Court hotel in Nanyuki, a town in the east of Kenya, where the army has a military base, BATUK.\nHer family spent two months looking for her, until her body was found stuffed into a septic tank in the grounds of the hotel. She had been stabbed several times.\nSix years ago, an inquest in Kenya found that Wanjiru, who was mother to a then baby girl, had been killed by one or more British soldiers.\nIn 2021, several soldiers, who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s regiment, came forward to name a suspect.\nOne offered startling testimony in which he claimed the suspect, a fellow Duke of Lancaster soldier, had confessed to her murder on the night, and taken him to see Wanjiru’s body in the septic tank.\nWhile a British soldier is believed to be the primary suspect in the case, under the UK-Kenya defence cooperation agreement, jurisdiction for investigating the murder lies with the Kenyan authorities.\nKenyan police have flown to the UK several times, and are believed to have questioned multiple witnesses. In April, Kenyan police said a file had been passed to the Kenyan director of public prosecutions for a charging decision.\nYet almost four years on from a suspect being identified, nobody has been arrested or charged in relation to the murder.\nWanjiru’s niece Esther Njoki, 21, was eight years old in 2012, and said her memories of her aunt drove her fight for justice.\n“The reason why I’m passionate about this case and that I’ve been fighting, it’s what she did in the family,” she said.\nSign up to Headlines UK\nGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\n“She used to take care of me when my mum was not there. She used to cook, braid my hair, everything. So that’s why I’m so passionate to fight for her rights.”\n“She was always jovial, smiling, hard-working. We were always laughing because of her jokes and everything,” she added. “It’s very heartbreaking. She was kind, she was everything, we miss her.”\nWhile in opposition, Healey called for more to be done to “pursue justice for Agnes and her family”, but Njoki says they are disappointed that more has not been done in the year since Labour came to power.\n“I think he just made a promise for his political gain,” Njoki said, “I think he’s taking us for a ride.”\n“They hide behind investigation,” she added, “because every time we raise any issue, they say ‘investigation, investigation’, we don’t know the status of the investigation.”\nNjoki, who is studying communications and acts as a spokesperson for the family, is currently raising funds to come to the UK in the autumn in order to meet with campaigners, hold a press conference, and lobby politicians directly.\n“I want to come and lobby there, so that they can take this matter seriously,” she said, “because they know the family can’t come to UK to seek justice there.”\nJustice, Njoki said, would mean closure. Her family believed that the government could do more.\n“They have power, but they have refused, and it’s heartbreaking,” she said. “Agnes was a human being.”\n“I think if she were around right now, everything would be so perfect,” she added, “but now that she’s not there, we are left to seek justice for her, with our hearts broken, being frustrated, and it’s the worst thing.”\nTessa Gregory, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, who is acting on behalf of the family, said: “It is now 13 years since Agnes’ body was found in a septic tank, the Kenyan criminal investigation has been ongoing for years, and while the file was reportedly sent to the [Kenyan] DPP months ago, a charging decision is still awaited. The family are frustrated with both the lack of progress in the criminal proceedings and the lack of engagement from the British government.”\nShe added: “They hope that the secretary of state will do everything within his power to ensure that those held responsible are brought to account swiftly and that the role of the British army in Agnes’ death, including as to why nothing was done for nearly a decade after the murder, is thoroughly and independently examined.”\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru, and the defence secretary has long recognised the tragic circumstances of her death.\n“The jurisdiction for this investigation lies with the Kenyan authorities.

    "content": "Niece of Agnes Wanjiru says she thinks John Healey is ‘taking us for a ride’\nThe niece of a Kenyan woman who was murdered more than a decade ago, allegedly by British soldiers, has said her family now believe the defence secretary “just made a promise for his political gain” when he met them in April.\nJohn Healey told the family of Agnes Wanjiru of his “determination to see a resolution” in the case of her murder, pledging the UK’s full support for the investigation.\nBut now, almost four months later, Wanjiru’s family say they have been left disappointed, having seen no further progress in their fight for justice.\nWanjiru, then 21, disappeared in March 2012, after last being seen drinking with British soldiers at a bar in the Lion’s Court hotel in Nanyuki, a town in the east of Kenya, where the army has a military base, BATUK.\nHer family spent two months looking for her, until her body was found stuffed into a septic tank in the grounds of the hotel. She had been stabbed several times.\nSix years ago, an inquest in Kenya found that Wanjiru, who was mother to a then baby girl, had been killed by one or more British soldiers.\nIn 2021, several soldiers, who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s regiment, came forward to name a suspect.\nOne offered startling testimony in which he claimed the suspect, a fellow Duke of Lancaster soldier, had confessed to her murder on the night, and taken him to see Wanjiru’s body in the septic tank.\nWhile a British soldier is believed to be the primary suspect in the case, under the UK-Kenya defence cooperation agreement, jurisdiction for investigating the murder lies with the Kenyan authorities.\nKenyan police have flown to the UK several times, and are believed to have questioned multiple witnesses. In April, Kenyan police said a file had been passed to the Kenyan director of public prosecutions for a charging decision.\nYet almost four years on from a suspect being identified, nobody has been arrested or charged in relation to the murder.\nWanjiru’s niece Esther Njoki, 21, was eight years old in 2012, and said her memories of her aunt drove her fight for justice.\n“The reason why I’m passionate about this case and that I’ve been fighting, it’s what she did in the family,” she said.\nSign up to Headlines UK\nGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\n“She used to take care of me when my mum was not there. She used to cook, braid my hair, everything. So that’s why I’m so passionate to fight for her rights.”\n“She was always jovial, smiling, hard-working. We were always laughing because of her jokes and everything,” she added. “It’s very heartbreaking. She was kind, she was everything, we miss her.”\nWhile in opposition, Healey called for more to be done to “pursue justice for Agnes and her family”, but Njoki says they are disappointed that more has not been done in the year since Labour came to power.\n“I think he just made a promise for his political gain,” Njoki said, “I think he’s taking us for a ride.”\n“They hide behind investigation,” she added, “because every time we raise any issue, they say ‘investigation, investigation’, we don’t know the status of the investigation.”\nNjoki, who is studying communications and acts as a spokesperson for the family, is currently raising funds to come to the UK in the autumn in order to meet with campaigners, hold a press conference, and lobby politicians directly.\n“I want to come and lobby there, so that they can take this matter seriously,” she said, “because they know the family can’t come to UK to seek justice there.”\nJustice, Njoki said, would mean closure. Her family believed that the government could do more.\n“They have power, but they have refused, and it’s heartbreaking,” she said. “Agnes was a human being.”\n“I think if she were around right now, everything would be so perfect,” she added, “but now that she’s not there, we are left to seek justice for her, with our hearts broken, being frustrated, and it’s the worst thing.”\nTessa Gregory, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, who is acting on behalf of the family, said: “It is now 13 years since Agnes’ body was found in a septic tank, the Kenyan criminal investigation has been ongoing for years, and while the file was reportedly sent to the [Kenyan] DPP months ago, a charging decision is still awaited. The family are frustrated with both the lack of progress in the criminal proceedings and the lack of engagement from the British government.”\nShe added: “They hope that the secretary of state will do everything within his power to ensure that those held responsible are brought to account swiftly and that the role of the British army in Agnes’ death, including as to why nothing was done for nearly a decade after the murder, is thoroughly and independently examined.”\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru, and the defence secretary has long recognised the tragic circumstances of her death.\n“The jurisdiction for this investigation lies with the Kenyan authorities.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.\nFar-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited and prayed at Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site on Sunday, the al-Aqsa compound, triggering a wave of regional condemnation and sparking fears of further escalations in tensions.\nThe provocative move came as Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip continue, with at least 33 Palestinians killed on Sunday enroute to aid distribution points, as global criticisms mount over Israel manufacturing famine-like conditions in the besieged enclave.\nBen-Gvir’s visit to the hillside compound threatens to further setback efforts by international mediators, such as Qatar and Egypt, to bring an end to Israel’s almost two-year military offensive on Gaza.\nThe area, which Jews call the ‘Temple Mount’, is the holiest site in Judaism and is believed to be home to the ancient biblical temples. Muslims however call the site the ‘Noble Sanctuary’, which today is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam’s third-holiest site.\nVisits to the site, the first Islamic Qibla – the direction Muslims across the world pray towards, by Israeli officials are considered a provocation across the Arab and Muslim world. Openly praying on the premises violates a longstanding status quo.\nJews have been allowed to visit and tour the holy compound, but are barred from praying there, with Israeli troops and police meant to ensure that as they protect the premises. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says Israel would not change the norms governing the site following Ben-Gvir’s visit.\nThe far-right minister visited the site following Hamas’ release of videos showing an Israeli hostage in Gaza appearing thin and weak. The video sparked an uproar in Israel and piled pressure on Netanyahu’s government to strike a deal to bring back the remaining hostages.\nSome 50 hostages are still under Hamas captivity in Gaza, 20 of which are still believed to be alive. They were taken after Hamas staged an attack on southern Israel on 7 October, 2023, killing 1,200 people.\nIsrael’s mission to the UN said it requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on the hostages, which will take place Tuesday.\n“They do not want a deal,” Netanyahu said of Hamas. “They want to break us using these videos of horror.”\nHis office said it spoke with the Red Cross to seek help in providing the hostages with food and medical care. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was “appalled by the harrowing videos” and called for access to the hostages.\nHamas' military wing said it was ready to respond positively to Red Cross requests to deliver food to hostages, if humanitarian corridors are opened in a “regular and permanent manner” in Gaza.\nBen-Gvir called for Israel to formally annex the Gaza Strip and renewed his desire to a Palestinian expulsion from the territory, with it reviving rhetoric that has complicated hostage deal and ceasefire negotiations.\nHe said the video showing 24-year-old Evyatar David in a dimly lit tunnel is an attempt to pressure Israel and increase global criticism against it to strike a deal, which he opposed, instead endorsing further attacks on Gaza.\nHis visit was condemned as an incitement by Palestinian leaders, as well as Jordan – custodians of the al-Aqsa Mosque, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Houthi rebels in Yemen fired three drones at Israel shortly after, which Israel said were intercepted.\nBen-Gvir’s previous visits to the holy site caused an eruption in violence in and around the site, fuelling an 11-day war with Hamas in 2021.\nHealth officials in Gaza say Israeli forces killed 33 Palestinians on Sunday enroute to aid distribution hubs on Sunday. Eyewitnesses say Israeli forces opened fire as hungry crowds surged towards the aid sites.\nWitness Yousef Abed described coming under indiscriminate fire and seeing at least three people bleeding on the ground. “I couldn’t stop and help them because of the bullets,” he said.\nTwo hospitals in southern and central Gaza said they received bodies from routes leading to the Israeli-backed US company, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s (GHF) aid sites, including 11 killed in the Teina area while trying to reach the hub in Khan Younis.\nThree Palestinian eyewitnesses, including one traveling through Teina, said they saw soldiers open fire on the routes, which are in military zones.\nIsrael's military said it was not aware of casualties as a result of its gunfire near aid sites. GHF’s media office said there was no gunfire “near or at our sites.”\nThe United Nations says 859 people were killed near GHF sites from 27 May to 31 July and hundreds of others have been killed along the routes of UN-led food convoys.\nGHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to prevent deadly crowding. The IDF said it only fires warning shots. Both claim the death tolls have been exaggerated.\nGaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry says 93 children and 82 adults have died so far from malnutrition-related causes.\nThe UN says 500-600 aid trucks are needed daily to satisfy the needs of Gaza’s two million population, only a fraction of that enters the enclave in what it described as a man-made humanitarian catastrophe.\nMalnutrition-related deaths are not included in the ministry’s war casualty count.\nThe ministry says the death toll from Israeli attacks across Gaza is now nearing 61,000. Their figures do not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties, but the UN says deaths it has been able to verify indicate that more than two-thirds were women and children.\nAdditional sources • AP\nBrowse today's tags",

    "content": "The FCA's policy shift comes amid growing confidence in market maturity and robust infrastructure.\nCover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\nThe UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has formally lifted its 2021 ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (cETNs) for retail investors.\nIn an Aug. 1 announcement, the regulator confirmed that these products will now be available on UK-regulated markets, marking a significant policy shift to broaden access to digital asset investments.\nThe original ban was introduced amid concerns over market volatility and consumer protection. At the time, the FCA argued that crypto ETNs carried “inherent risks, ” making them unsuitable for individual investors.\nHowever, the regulator now believes the market has matured sufficiently to justify a controlled reintroduction, highlighting better infrastructure, increased transparency, and a more informed investing public.\nDavid Geale, the FCA’s Executive Director of Payments and Digital Assets, said the regulator’s decision reflects changing market conditions. According to Geale, crypto investment products are now more comprehensible, and the supporting infrastructure has advanced.\nThis move mirrors global trends, particularly in the U.S., where crypto-linked ETFs—especially those tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum—have experienced rapid growth. The broader digital asset market has also gained momentum amid a more supportive regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration.\nDespite the move toward inclusion, the FCA continues to urge caution.\nAccording to the regulator, crypto ETNs remain unprotected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), meaning retail investors will not be eligible for reimbursement in the event of losses.\nTo minimize consumer risk, providers of cETNs must comply with updated financial promotion rules and ensure all marketing materials are fair, transparent, and not misleading.\nGeale also stressed the critical importance of transparency and investor education in the space. According to him, firms offering cETNs must help customers assess whether such instruments align with their financial objectives and risk profiles.\nMeanwhile, the FCA stressed that it is still restricting retail trading of crypto derivatives. The regulator considers those products too complex and volatile for the general public.\nThis policy update is part of the UK’s broader push to create a structured regulatory environment for digital assets. As part of its long-term crypto roadmap, the FCA is expected to introduce additional proposals for investor protection and market integrity.\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.\nAJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

    "title": "Five children see HIV viral loads vanish after tak 20250804 052317",
    "content": "The first widespread success in curing HIV may come from children, not adults.\nFor years, Philip Goulder has been obsessed with a particularly captivating idea: In the hunt for an HIV cure, could children hold the answers?\nStarting in the mid-2010s, the University of Oxford pediatrician and immunologist began working with scientists in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, with the aim of tracking several hundred children who had acquired HIV from their mothers, either during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\nAfter putting the children on antiretroviral drugs early in their lives to control the virus, Goulder and his colleagues were keen to monitor their progress and adherence to standard antiretroviral treatment, which stops HIV from replicating. But over the following decade, something unusual happened. Five of the children stopped coming to the clinic to collect their drugs, and when the team eventually tracked them down many months later, they appeared to be in perfect health.\n“Instead of their viral loads being through the roof, they were undetectable,” says Goulder. “And normally HIV rebounds within two or three weeks.”\nIn a study published last year, Goulder described how all five remained in remission, despite having not received regular antiretroviral medication for some time, and in one case, up to 17 months. In the decadeslong search for an HIV cure, this offered a tantalizing insight: that the first widespread success in curing HIV might not come in adults, but in children.\nAt the recent International AIDS Society conference held in Kigali, Rwanda, in mid-July, Alfredo Tagarro, a pediatrician at the Infanta Sofia University Hospital in Madrid, presented a new study showing that around 5 percent of HIV-infected children who receive antiretrovirals within the first six months of life ultimately suppress the HIV viral reservoir—the number of cells harboring the virus’s genetic material—to negligible levels. “Children have special immunological features which makes it more likely that we will develop an HIV cure for them before other populations,” says Tagarro.\nHis thoughts were echoed by another doctor, Mark Cotton, who directs the children’s infectious diseases clinical research unit at the University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town.\n“Kids have a much more dynamic immune system,” says Cotton. “They also don’t have any additional issues like high blood pressure or kidney problems. It makes them a better target, initially, for a cure.”\nAccording to Tagarro, children with HIV have long been “left behind” in the race to find a treatment that can put HIV-positive individuals permanently into remission. Since 2007, 10 adults are thought to have been cured, having received stem cell transplants to treat life-threatening blood cancer, a procedure which ended up eliminating the virus. Yet with such procedures being both complex and highly risky—other patients have died in the aftermath of similar attempts—it is not considered a viable strategy for specifically targeting HIV.\nInstead, like Goulder, pediatricians have increasingly noticed that after starting antiretroviral treatment early in life, a small subpopulation of children then seem able to suppress HIV for months, years, and perhaps even permanently with their immune system alone. This realization initially began with certain isolated case studies: the “Mississippi baby” who controlled the virus for more than two years without medication, and a South African child who was considered potentially cured having kept the virus in remission for more than a decade. Cotton says he suspects that between 10 and 20 percent of all HIV-infected children would be capable of controlling the virus for a significant period of time, beyond the typical two to three weeks, after stopping antiretrovirals.\nGoulder is now launching a new study to try and examine this phenomenon in more detail, taking 19 children in South Africa who have suppressed HIV to negligible levels on antiretrovirals, stopping the drugs, and seeing how many can prevent the virus from rebounding, with the aim of understanding why. To date, he says that six of them have been able to control the virus without any drugs for more than 18 months. Based on what he’s seen so far, he has a number of ideas about what could be happening. In particular, it appears that boys are more likely to better control the virus due to a quirk of gender biology to do with the innate immune system, the body’s first-line defense against pathogens.\n“The female innate immune system both in utero and in childhood is much more aggressive than the male equivalent when it encounters and senses viruses like HIV,” says Goulder. “Usually that’s a good thing, but because HIV infects activated immune cells, it actually seems to make girls more vulnerable to being infected.”\nIn addition, Goulder notes that because female fetuses share the same innate immune system as their mothers, the virus transmitted to them is an HIV strain that has become resistant to the female innate immune response.\nThere could also be other explanations for the long-lasting suppression seen in some children. In some cases, Goulder has observed that the transmitted strain of HIV has been weakened through needing to undergo changes to circumvent the mother’s adaptive immune response, the part of the immune system which learns to target specific viruses and other pathogens. He has also noted that male infants experience particularly large surges of testosterone in the first six months of life—a period known as “mini-puberty”—which can enhance their immune system in various ways that help them fight the virus.\nSuch revelations are particularly tantalizing as HIV researchers are starting to get access to a far more potent toolbox of therapeutics. Leading the way are so-called bNAbs, or broadly neutralizing antibodies, which have the ability to recognize and fight many different strains of HIV, as well as stimulating the immune system to destroy cells where HIV is hiding. There are also a growing number of therapeutic vaccines in development that can train the immune system’s T cells to target and destroy HIV reservoirs. Children tend to respond to various vaccines better than adults, and Goulder says that if some children are already proving relatively adept at controlling the virus on the back of standard antiretrovirals, these additional therapeutics could give them the additional assistance they need to eradicate HIV altogether.\nIn the coming years, this is set to be tested in several clinical trials. Cotton is leading the most ambitious attempt, which will see HIV-infected children receive a combination of antiretroviral therapy, three bNAbs, and a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, while in a separate trial, Goulder is examining the potential of a different bNAb together with antiretrovirals to see whether it can help more children achieve long-term remission.\n“We think that adding the effects of these broadly neutralizing antibodies to antiretrovirals will help us chip away at what is needed to achieve a cure,” says Goulder. “It’s a little bit like with leukemia, where treatments have steadily improved, and now the outlook for most children affected is incredibly good. Realistically in most cases, curing HIV probably requires a few hits from different angles, impacting the way that the virus can grow, and tackling it with different immune responses at the same time to essentially force it into a cul-de-sac that it can’t escape from.”\nChildren are also being viewed as the ideal target population for an even more ambitious experimental treatment, a one-time gene therapy that delivers instructions directing the body’s own muscle cells to produce a continuous stream of bNAbs, without the need for repeated infusions. Maurico Martins, an associate professor at the University of Florida, who is pioneering this new approach, feels that it could represent a particularly practical strategy for low-income countries where HIV transmission to children is particularly rife, and mothers often struggle to keep their children on repeated medication.\n“In regions like Uganda or parts of South Africa where this is very prevalent, you could also give this therapy to a baby right after birth as a preventative measure, protecting the newborn child against acquisition of HIV through breastfeeding and maybe even through sexual intercourse later in life,” says Martins.\nWhile Martins also hopes that gene therapy could benefit HIV-infected adults in future, he feels it has more of a chance of initially succeeding in children because their nascent immune systems are less likely to launch what he calls an anti-drug response that can destroy the therapeutic bNAbs.\n“It’s very difficult for most antibodies to recognize the HIV envelope protein because it’s buried deep within a sugar coat,” says Martins. “To overcome that, these bNAbs carry a lot of mutations and extensions to their arms which allow them to penetrate that sugar coat. But the problem then is that they’re often viewed by your own immune system as foreign, and it starts making these anti-bNAb antibodies.”\nBut when Martins tested the therapy in newborn rhesus macaques, it was far more effective. “We found that the first few days or two weeks after birth comprised a sort of sweet spot for this gene therapy,” he says. “And that’s why this could really work very well in treating and preventing pediatric HIV infections.”\nLike many HIV scientists, Martins has run into recent funding challenges, with a previous commitment from the National Institutes of Health to support a clinical trial of the novel therapy in HIV-infected children being withdrawn. However, he is hoping that the trial will still go ahead. “We’re now talking with the Gates Foundation to see whether they can sponsor it,” he says.\nWhile children still comprise the minority of overall HIV infections, being able to cure them may yield further insights that help with the wider goal of an overall curative therapy.\n“We can learn a lot from them because they are different,” says Goulder. “I think we can learn how to achieve a cure in kids if we continue along this pathway, and from there, that will have applications in adults as well.”\nThis story originally appeared on wired.com.\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Ford Ranger Wildtrak X strikes the perfect balance 20250804 060744",
    "content": "LOGIN\nFord continues to have massive success in South Africa in terms of car sales. In June, it sold over 3 000 vehicles and the Ranger made up 2 318 of those sales.\nWhether it is the 4×2 or 4×4 Ranger, South Africans love these bakkies. In fact, I’m sure we’ve all been in a position where a Ford Ranger has tailed our backside and forced us to move into a slower lane on the highway.\nI had the privilege of being one of those guys for a week. The Ford Ranger Wildtrak X arrived in my driveway with its striking looks, capable roof rails and subtle, but essential, cyber-orange accent under the grille.\nIt is by far the most stylish Ranger of all. There’s just something about a Wildtrak that gives it a distinctive identity. It could be the black lettering across the front and back or the black oval Ford badges — or even the aluminium side steps.\nIt gives off a very stylish, but rugged, look that makes it feel like more than a bakkie or a workhorse.\nThat’s just the exterior.\nThe interior adds to it. There are elements, like the suede material that adorns the glovebox, instrument cluster hood and door trim, that emphasises that the car is not afraid to get dirty and reiterates the ruggedness of the vehicle.\nYou even have a built-in 400W/240v inverter which can be accessed from the rear of the centre console, as well as from the auxiliary power points in the load compartment. You could essentially connect your toaster if you were ever out camping.\nBut, on the other hand, the very attractive portrait-oriented 12-inch touchscreen, the comfortable leather seats that embrace the cyber-orange stitching and features such as wireless charging bring a sense of refinement into the cabin.\nYou don’t need to drive the vehicle to actually know what it’s about. But when you do drive it, it just confirms that feeling.\nThe Ranger Wildtrak X is powered by a 2.0-litre Bi-Turbo diesel engine that produces 154kW of power and 500Nm of torque, which is paired to a surprisingly smooth 10-speed automatic gearbox.\nIt is the first Ranger 2.0L Bi-Turbo model to be available with Ford’s on-demand four-wheel drive system that offers four modes. It can be driven in 4A (automatic) on high-traction surfaces, with the system continuously distributing power between the front and rear axles for optimum performance in all on-road conditions. The driver can also select 2H for on-road driving, as well as four-wheel drive high-range (4H) and low-range (4L) for more challenging off-road terrain.\nI love being behind the wheel of the big, rugged bakkies but sometimes that means sacrificing a refined driving experience.\nNobody doubts the off-road capabilities of the vehicle but the Ranger Wildtrak X surprised me when it came to riding on the tarmac.\nThe gearshifts were as smooth as butter when picking up speed, the turbolag was not as bad as it usually is on a bakkie and the roads didn’t feel bumpy at all.\nIn fact, you could be forgiven for thinking that you were driving a Ford Everest when you are in the Wildtrak X. It brings that sort of refinement to the driving experience but can still tackle off-road conditions with ease.\nIt was a pleasure to drive a total of 200km in it on a trip from Springs to Pretoria and back.\nThe car handled the bendy highways with ease. No bumps, no bruises and certainly no perception of bulkiness for a car that weighs over 2.3 tonnes.\nEven the backseat passengers were comfortable with the amount of headroom and legroom that they were offered.\nThe Wildtrak X raises the bar in terms of safety compared to the normal Wildtrak.\nIt has a 30mm wider stance to provide an even more stable footprint off-road, while ground clearance has risen by 26mm, helping owners to negotiate more challenging terrain with confidence.\nThe Wildtrak X features seven driving modes that cover everyday and off-road driving (Normal, Eco, Tow/Haul, Slippery, Mud/Ruts, Sand and Rock Crawl), and comes equipped with a comprehensive suite of driver assistance and safety systems. These include active park assist; blind spot information system with cross-traffic alert and braking; adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go and lane centring; lane departure warning and a 360-degree camera as standard.\nIt also comes with trail assist and trail control.\nTrail assist negotiates tight bends on narrow tracks by applying the brake on the inside rear wheel which reduces the turning radius by up to 25%, while Trail Control helps drivers maintain constant low speed while driving off-road. The driver simply selects a set speed below 32km/h and the vehicle will manage its acceleration and braking while the driver concentrates on steering through difficult terrain.\nOverall, the Wildtrak X strikes that balance between ruggedness and refinement perfectly.\nIt also is positioned perfectly as the highest-spec model before the two V6 variants, the Platinum and the Raptor.\nBut, it does come in at over R1 million. If it’s the style that you are after, then R1 070 500 will get you the Wildtrak X, but if you are a power hunter, then add the R80 000 and go for the V6 Platinum variant.\nAbout\nContact\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nWhatsApp Channel\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\n\nTikTok\n\nThreads\n200 Young South Africans\nPower Of Women\nGreening The Future\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nEthics & Social Media Policy\nMail & Guardian Careers\nProperty for sale\n© 2025 The Mail & Guardian.

    "content": "The sheet of paper says \"Wanted Person\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.\nAt the bottom, in red, are the words: \"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\" together with a UK phone number.\nTo earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\".\nThe woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.\nWe are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\n\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.\nCarmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.\nShe argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.\nThere are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.\nThe plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.\nThe site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.\nThe plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\n\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.\nBack in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.\nChina's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China.

She shudders when she looks at the building.\nWe are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\n\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.\nCarmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.\nShe argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.\nThere are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.\nThe plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.\nThe site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.\nThe plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\n\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.\nBack in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.\nChina's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China.

She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.\nAt the bottom, in red, are the words: \"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\" together with a UK phone number.\nTo earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\".\nThe woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.\nWe are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\n\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.\nCarmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.\nShe argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.\nThere are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.\nThe plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.\nThe site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.\nThe plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\n\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.\nBack in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.\nChina's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.\nShe claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\n\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\"\nCarmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.\nHong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\".\nThe bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\n\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\" she says.\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.\nHe argues \"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\"\nBut he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.\nThe Chinese embassy told the BBC it \"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\".\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.\nThe site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.\nAnd in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.\nAccording to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.\nAn official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\n\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\" he says.\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.\nRegarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\n\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\" he says.\n\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\"\nOpponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.\nMostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\n\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\"\nThe Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\".\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.\nRather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.\nOn 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.\nThis is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \"golden era\" of UK-China relations were over.\nFor his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\n\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\" he argues.\n\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\"\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.\nA National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \"continued tension\" over human rights and cyber security.\nBut is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\n\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\" says Lord Ricketts. \"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\n\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\"\nThe embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\n\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\"\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\" he tells me.\nBut for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\n\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\" he argues, \"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\"\nHe is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\n\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists.

    "content": "The sheet of paper says \"Wanted Person\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.\nAt the bottom, in red, are the words: \"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\" together with a UK phone number.\nTo earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\".\nThe woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.\nWe are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\n\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.\nCarmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.\nShe argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.\nThere are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.\nThe plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.\nThe site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.\nThe plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\n\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.\nBack in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.\nChina's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.\nShe claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\n\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\"\nCarmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.\nHong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\".\nThe bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\n\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\" she says.\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.\nHe argues \"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\"\nBut he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.\nThe Chinese embassy told the BBC it \"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\".\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.\nThe site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.\nAnd in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.\nAccording to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.\nAn official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\n\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\" he says.\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.\nRegarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\n\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\" he says.\n\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\"\nOpponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.\nMostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\n\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\"\nThe Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\".\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.\nRather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.\nOn 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks.

The ICRC also says on its website that it “has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023.”\nIn a separate statement on Sunday, the ICRC said it was also “appalled” that a Palestine Red Crescent Society staff member had been killed in a “clearly marked Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) building” in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.\nThe PRCS had earlier said the attack was perpetrated by Israeli forces, but the ICRC statement did not refer to who was responsible.\nMeanwhile, the families of Israeli captives held in Gaza said on Sunday that Netanyahu’s continued insistence that a “military resolution” was the only solution was “a direct danger to the lives of our sons, who live in the hell of tunnels and are threatened by starvation and immediate death”.\n“For 22 months, the public has been sold the illusion that military pressure will bring back the hostages, and today, even before reaching a comprehensive draft agreement, it is said that an agreement is futile,” the families said in a statement.\nThere are about 50 captives still in Gaza. Fewer than half are believed to be still alive.\nThe latest developments come as the Government Media Office in Gaza said that Israeli authorities allowed just 36 aid trucks to enter the Gaza Strip on Saturday, while 22,000 aid trucks continue to sit outside the Strip waiting to bring much-needed food to Palestinians there.\nThe United Nations office in Geneva on Sunday also warned that 1 million women and girls in Gaza are now starving.\nIn a post on X, the UN said: “One million. That’s how many women and girls are starving in Gaza. This horrific situation is unacceptable and must end.\nWe continue to demand the delivery of lifesaving aid for all women and girls, an immediate ceasefire, and the release of all hostages.”\nAt least 175 people, including 93 children, have now been confirmed dead from forced starvation, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health, including 17-year-old Atef Abu Khater, whose weight had dropped to just 25kg (55lbs) before he died on Saturday.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "content": "Israeli PM earlier asked for the International Committee of the Red Cross to intervene to help captives as just 36 aid trucks entered Gaza on Saturday.\nHamas has said it is open to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delivering aid to Israeli captives in Gaza after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he requested the Geneva-based international organisation to step in.\nThe statements from Hamas and Netanyahu came after Palestinian groups last week released videos showing two emaciated Israeli captives held in Gaza, where some 2 million Palestinians are struggling to survive the Israeli-induced starvation crisis.\nNetanyahu said on Sunday he had spoken to Julian Larson, the head of the ICRC delegation to Israel, requesting the group’s “immediate involvement” in providing food and medical treatment to captives still held in Gaza.\nIn a post on X, Netanyahu wrote in Hebrew that he told Larson that Hamas was propagating a “lie of starvation” in the enclave, but the reality was that “systematic starvation is being carried out against our hostages”.\nLater on Sunday, the spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing, said in a statement that Israeli captives held in Gaza “eat what our fighters and all our people eat”.\n“They will not receive any special privilege amid the crime of starvation and siege,” the spokesman, known as Abu Obeida, said.\nBut, he added, the group is “ready to act positively and respond to any request from the Red Cross to deliver food and medicine to enemy prisoners”.\nIn order for requests to aid captives to be accepted, “humanitarian corridors must be opened in a normal and permanent manner for the passage of food and medicine to all our people in all areas of the Gaza Strip”, Abu Obeida said.\nIsraeli attacks “of all forms must cease during the receipt of packages for the prisoners”, he added.\nThe ICRC said in a statement on Sunday that it was “appalled by the harrowing videos” of the captives held in Gaza and reiterated its call to be “granted access to the hostages.”\n“These videos are stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held,” the ICRC said in the statement shared on X.\n“We know families watching these videos are horrified and heartbroken by the conditions they see their loved ones held in,” the ICRC added.\nOn its website, the ICRC says that “securing access requires the cooperation of all parties involved”. The ICRC also says on its website that it “has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023.”\nIn a separate statement on Sunday, the ICRC said it was also “appalled” that a Palestine Red Crescent Society staff member had been killed in a “clearly marked Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) building” in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.\nThe PRCS had earlier said the attack was perpetrated by Israeli forces, but the ICRC statement did not refer to who was responsible.\nMeanwhile, the families of Israeli captives held in Gaza said on Sunday that Netanyahu’s continued insistence that a “military resolution” was the only solution was “a direct danger to the lives of our sons, who live in the hell of tunnels and are threatened by starvation and immediate death”.\n“For 22 months, the public has been sold the illusion that military pressure will bring back the hostages, and today, even before reaching a comprehensive draft agreement, it is said that an agreement is futile,” the families said in a statement.\nThere are about 50 captives still in Gaza. Fewer than half are believed to be still alive.\nThe latest developments come as the Government Media Office in Gaza said that Israeli authorities allowed just 36 aid trucks to enter the Gaza Strip on Saturday, while 22,000 aid trucks continue to sit outside the Strip waiting to bring much-needed food to Palestinians there.\nThe United Nations office in Geneva on Sunday also warned that 1 million women and girls in Gaza are now starving.\nIn a post on X, the UN said: “One million. That’s how many women and girls are starving in Gaza. This horrific situation is unacceptable and must end.\nWe continue to demand the delivery of lifesaving aid for all women and girls, an immediate ceasefire, and the release of all hostages.”\nAt least 175 people, including 93 children, have now been confirmed dead from forced starvation, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health, including 17-year-old Atef Abu Khater, whose weight had dropped to just 25kg (55lbs) before he died on Saturday.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

Of the 50 who remain captive, just over 20 were believed to be alive as of late June, according to the prime minister's office.\nThe forum quoted Witkoff as saying: “We know who is alive, and someone will be to blame if they don’t come out alive.” NBC News was not able to independently confirm the comment.\nThe meeting came a day after Witkoff made a short and extremely rare trip into Gaza alongside Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, in a visit condemned by some as a publicity stunt.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke \"at length\" with the families of the two men on Saturday night, expressing \"deep shock\" at the recordings released by Hamas, according to his office.\nIn a statement, Netanyahu accused Hamas of \"deliberately starving\" both hostages and Palestinian civilians in Gaza by \"preventing them from receiving aid.\"\nDavid's brother similarly accused Hamas of \"starving him deliberately\" during Saturday's rally.\nIsraeli authorities have repeatedly accused Hamas of diverting aid from Palestinian civilians throughout the war. But multiple aid groups have said they saw no signs of aid diversion, while an internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft of aid supplies by Hamas, according to a report presented to State Department officials and later seen by NBC News.

The DMK members had made remarks on the personal life of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\nThe court was hearing separate petitions filed by Aarur Senthamilan who sought to quash the proceedings pending before Dindigul court and that of Kuttus Gurusamy and Illa Pugalenthi who sought to quash the proceedings pending before the Srivilliputtur court in Virudhunagar district.\nIn both the cases, the Public Prosecutor filed a private complaint against the petitioners and sanction for prosecution was obtained as per Section 199 (4) CrPC. The petitioners argued that the public prosecutor was not competent to file the private complaint on behalf of the Chief Minister.\nThe entire speech was with regard to the personal life of the former Chief Minister and not with the reference to the discharge of any public function. As per Section 199 (2) CrPC, the public prosecutor can file a complaint for defamation only if it was in connection with the discharge of duties of a public servant in connection with the affairs of the State. The complaint was filed out of political vendetta, they said.\nJustice G. Ilangovan observed that the text of the speeches showed that it was not in good taste. The speeches were made in connection with the private life of, and not in connection with the discharge of duties in the capacity of Chief Minister.\nRelying on Supreme Court and Madras High Court judgements, the judge observed that if at all a private complaint was to be filed, it ought to have been filed only by the affected party - the former Chief Minister. The office of the Public Prosecutor cannot be engaged for this purpose, the judge said and quashed the trial court proceedings against the DMK members.\nPublished - April 12, 2021 08:51 pm IST\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The DMK members had made remarks on the personal life of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\nThe court was hearing separate petitions filed by Aarur Senthamilan who sought to quash the proceedings pending before Dindigul court and that of Kuttus Gurusamy and Illa Pugalenthi who sought to quash the proceedings pending before the Srivilliputtur court in Virudhunagar district.\nIn both the cases, the Public Prosecutor filed a private complaint against the petitioners and sanction for prosecution was obtained as per Section 199 (4) CrPC. The petitioners argued that the public prosecutor was not competent to file the private complaint on behalf of the Chief Minister.\nThe entire speech was with regard to the personal life of the former Chief Minister and not with the reference to the discharge of any public function. As per Section 199 (2) CrPC, the public prosecutor can file a complaint for defamation only if it was in connection with the discharge of duties of a public servant in connection with the affairs of the State. The complaint was filed out of political vendetta, they said.\nJustice G. Ilangovan observed that the text of the speeches showed that it was not in good taste. The speeches were made in connection with the private life of, and not in connection with the discharge of duties in the capacity of Chief Minister.\nRelying on Supreme Court and Madras High Court judgements, the judge observed that if at all a private complaint was to be filed, it ought to have been filed only by the affected party - the former Chief Minister. The office of the Public Prosecutor cannot be engaged for this purpose, the judge said and quashed the trial court proceedings against the DMK members.\nPublished - April 12, 2021 08:51 pm IST\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\nFox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\nHere’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 8, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\nKey false quote: “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.\n“That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. They were founded as a company to fix elections, they have a terrible record, and they are extremely hackable,” Giuliani said.\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 13, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\nKey false quote: “Let’s start with Dominion, a straight out disavowal of any claim of fraud against the company, its software or machines. Your reaction,” Dobbs asked.\nRelated article\nWhat to know ahead of the Fox News and Dominion trial\n“Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.\n“We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.\n“Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”\nThe broadcast: Quote-tweet by Dobbs of Giuliani tweet on November 14, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “Did you know a foreign company, DOMINION, was counting our vote in Michigan, Arizona and Georgia and other states,” Giuliani wrote.\n“Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 14, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “It was created for the express purpose of being able to alter votes and secure the reelection of Hugo Chavez and then Maduro. They’ve used it in Argentina,” Powell said. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.”\n“Yes. And hopefully the Department of Justice, but who knows anymore,” Pirro said.\nThe broadcast: “Fox & Friends Sunday” on November 15, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\nKey false quote: “Sidney Powell is also talking about potential kickbacks that government officials, who were asked to use Dominion, actually also enjoyed benefits to their families,” Bartiromo said. “We’re going to talk about that coming up as well.”\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 15, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\nKey false quote: “We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed. It was designed to rig elections … We have so much evidence, I feel like it’s coming in through a fire hose,” Powell said.\n“Wow,” Bartiromo said.\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 16, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said.\n“Sure,” Dobbs said.\nPowell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’”\nPowell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion.\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 18, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.\n“It’s outrageous,” Dobbs said.\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 19, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “Let me put it this way, there are thousands of people in federal prisons on far less evidence of criminal conduct than we have already against the Smartmatic and Dominion Systems companies,” Powell said.\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 21, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said.\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 24, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said.\n“I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said.\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 30, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, kickbacks.\nKey false quote: “Different states shaved different amounts of votes, or the system was set up to shave and flip different votes in different states,” Powell said. “Some people were targeted as individual candidates. It’s really the most massive and historical egregious fraud the world has ever seen.”\nThe broadcast: “Hannity” on November 30, 2020.\nRelated article\nTucker Carlson, Sean Hannity among prominent Fox hosts, execs set to take stand at defamation trial\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\nKey false quote: “The machine ran an algorithm that shaved votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden,” Powell said. “They used the machines to trash large batches of votes that should have been awarded to President Trump. And they used a machine to inject and add massive quantities of votes for Mr. Biden.”\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on December 4, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\nKey false quote: “Dominion Voting Systems, you have described it with algorithms which were designed to be inaccurate rather than to be a secure system,” Dobbs said.\n“Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\nThe broadcast: Dobbs tweet with embedded document on December 10, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\nKey false quote: “The 2020 Election is a cyber Pearl Harbor,” Dobbs wrote, embedding a document.\n“We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated.\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on December 10, 2020.\nRelated article\nFox News reaches settlement with Venezuelan businessman in election defamation case\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “Let me make you an offer, very straightforwardly,” Dobbs said. “We will gladly put forward your evidence that supports your claim that this was a Cyber Pearl Harbor. We have tremendous evidence already … of fraud in this election, but I will be glad to put forward on this broadcast whatever evidence you have, and we’ll be glad to do it immediately.”\nThe broadcast: Dobbs tweet with embedded video of Powell interview on December 10, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud.\nKey false quote: “Cyber Pearl Harbor: @SidneyPowell1 reveals groundbreaking new evidence indicating our Presidential election came under massive cyber-attack orchestrated with the help of Dominion, Smartmatic, and foreign adversaries. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\nThe broadcast: “Fox & Friends” with hosts Will Cain, Pete Hegseth and Rachel Campos-Duffy on December 12, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud.\nKey false quote: “We have a machine, the Dominion machine, that’s as filled with holes as Swiss cheese and was developed to steal elections, and being used in the states that are involved,” Giuliani said.\nThe broadcast: “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on January 26, 2021.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud.\nKey false quote: “Every outlet in the country, they go, ‘Mike Lindell, there’s no evidence, and he’s making fraudulent statements.’ No. I have the evidence. I dare people to put it on. I dare Dominion to sue me because then it will get out faster. So, this is – you know, they don’t – they don’t want to talk about it,” Lindell said.\n“No, they don’t,” Carlson said.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "content": "Bitcoin’s trademark volatility may be entering a new phase thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe agency's decision to raise position limits on options for most bitcoin ETFs could help smooth price swings by encouraging strategies like covered call selling, which caps the upside in exchange for steady income, according to NYDIG Research.\nThat increase in position limits for options trading on IBIT came as the regulator approved in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs.\nBy letting traders hold ten times more contracts than before, NYDIG wrote, the SEC has opened the door to more aggressive and sustained options activity. Covered call strategies, in particular, work best at scale.\nThey’re designed to earn yield from existing holdings by selling upside exposure, which can naturally suppress price movement if done across large portfolios.\nBitcoin’s volatility has already been on the decline, with Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index (DVOL) showing a steady decline from around 90 to 38 over the past four years.\nStill, it stands out compared to bonds, stocks, and other traditional assets. That makes it a tempting target for investors trying to collect income from market swings, effectively harvesting volatility, but also risky for institutions that require stable exposures.\n“As volatility declines, the asset becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. This dynamic could reinforce spot demand,” NYDIG’s analysts wrote.\nRay Dalio, one of the earliest champions of such risk-parity strategies, recently suggested a 15% allocation to gold and crypto amid rising debt levels.\n“The feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand,” the firm concluded.\nRead more: Wall Street Has Claimed Bitcoin—Now What?\nFrancisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

He said the number of cases of passengers intercepted by customs while trying to smuggle in cigarettes had risen by 50 per cent year on year in the first half of 2025.\n“Last year, we had 19,000 cases of cigarette smuggling by passengers. At this increasing rate of passenger smuggling, we could reach 30,000 cases this year,” Chan said.\nAs for illegal drug seizures, customs recorded a 24.3 per cent year-on-year drop in the first five months of 2025. There were 433 drug seizures involving 162 arrests from January to May, compared with 572 in the same period last year, with 167 arrests.\nBut the drug busts have created another issue: storage of the contraband in a secret, secure location until it can be disposed of following stringent procedures.",

    "content": "Contributor\nContributor\nThere is a day we New Yorkers quietly celebrate, that we don’t have a name for.It’s the morning when I can feel the earth peel back her blanket and stretch out for the first time in months. For once, she doesn’t have to reach for a sweater to throw over her nightgown; she might even step outside to greet the day.I do the same, stepping outside to bask in the symphony of new sounds: the silly flap of sandals against the pavement, the no‑nonsense buzz of a bee hard at work, the crunch of a bunny snacking on wildflowers. No, that’s me getting carried away; there are no bunnies in my industrial part of Brooklyn.But it is the first kiss of summer. If you live in bear country and not Brooklyn, the warm months are signaled not with sundress debuts and iced coffee orders, but with the grumbles and growls of furry beasts who have emerged from hibernation.Hibernation isn’t sleep. It’s a mastery of evolution, a collection of advanced adaptations and seemingly miraculous physiological strategies that allow so many critters to burrow underground for months without food or water and still look like their fuzzy, glorious selves as they totter out of their dens. After a hearty shake, the animals are rested and ready for action, with healthy, shiny fur coats at that.But, however wondrous and exotic the ritual seems, hibernation is a challenging concept when you really get to thinking about it: What if humans were just as in tune with our bodies? Would it work out for us? What if we followed our bodily cues as attentively as bears and other animals do?It took me a long time to learn I am a body. In a society that splits the mind as separate from the body, I question my own desires and needs as they arise. I even distrust them, commanding them to keep quiet so I can function normally in this culture that has so many ways to hide bodily requirements.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIn most of contemporary society, we are practically forced to disembody if we want to have any chance at fitting in, keeping a job, getting accepted, even being seen as fully human. It is so outrageous (yet somehow normal) that grocery stores sell “hunger-reducing” gum and Ozempic is easily accessible so that our bodies can’t tell us when to eat, and absurd that we follow a labor schedule that was created for machines, and so upsetting that things like periods and panic attacks are seen as pesky hindrances to be hidden and worked through rather than honored with rest and support.Read More: How To Use Your Body To Make Yourself Happier\nSomething I love about animals is that you never have to tell an animal “Be yourself.” They know no other way to be. Animals go to the bathroom, reject unwanted affection, gobble food, sleep for hours, and bite their toenails without a moment of hesitation or a shameful glance around to see if anyone’s looking.\nAdvertisement\nThe messages between their fuzzy bodies and their brains don’t go through any filtering system. Thought and action are practically one and the same: Hungry! Eat; Tired! Rest; Curious! Explore.Animals have mastered embodiment, the experience of being a body rather than having a body. They don’t separate their physical self as an unruly object to control, argue with, be proud of, or disdain.And for a long time, we humans were the same way. That is, until Plato came along and decided that body and mind were two different entities. His coping mechanism to escape the grind of Ancient Greece was to call the mind the “true self,” whereas a body was just a sloppy vessel to carry it around. While bodies were used and hurt by others, and, let’s face it, were kind of embarrassing, the mind was pure and could attain enlightenment.It’s an interesting idea, but it’s gotten us into all kinds of trouble throughout history. Disembodiment, which denies any inherent preciousness of the body, has been used in service to humanity’s most egregious sins, from slavery to eugenics. If you can separate a body from a person, you’re more likely to accept the use of that body as an object. It now means that we endure the legacy of disembodiment as an accepted concept.\nAdvertisement\nTake swimsuit season. As far as we’ve come from the SlimFast lunches and cabbage soup diet of the early 2000s, a lot of us still have diet culture leftovers lingering around in our minds when it comes to public displays of body appearance—especially their annual debuts in the summer.\nI used to feel nothing but dread when I’d realize while packing my beach bag that I’d forgotten to get those abs I meant to get over the winter, or that last night’s dinner party with friends was showing up in some extra tummy bloat. I treated my rolls and squishy parts like they were evidence of my failures—a visible symbol that I lacked the saintly discipline that I’ve envied in other girls since middle school.\nAdvertisement\nBut bodies are living things who are entitled to change, strengthen, soften, expand, and spill out as evidence of a life lived—not a life restricted. A dinner party with friends is one of my greatest pleasures, and I didn’t get around to those abs in winter because I was too busy enjoying time for needed and delicious rest. If I’m a little flabbier for naturally responding to my joys and environment, so be it. Plunging into a swimming pool is another one of my greatest pleasures, and we all deserve to feel the unselfconscious glory of being a body in water on a hot day.\nI quit blaming myself for my body’s naturalness when I learned to love life—not just my life, but the existence of any life on earth. The more I appreciated living things and their living-thing-ness, the more merciful I was toward myself. Subsequently, I learned to love signs of life: eye wrinkles, rolls of fat, chubby cheeks, jiggly arms, laugh lines, stretch marks, cellulite dimples, and colorful veins...all signs of vitality, age, changes, growth, and aliveness.I smile when I think about bears who never have to learn any of this. They eat when they’re hungry, wander when they’re restless, and sleep when they’re tired. Somehow, after months in a comfy cave, they witness summer as the rest of us do: with energy and renewal. And it’s because they never questioned what their bodies needed.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I catch myself questioning my needs, or scrutinizing my physical appearance, I remember what my soul experiences as a body: smelling the clothes of people I love, hearing cumbia music, applying blush, swimming in a cold lake, trying to stifle a laugh when it’s not appropriate to laugh, carrying an ice cream cone, twirling.The first time I realized all that was the first time I really felt at home here, in my body. I know what it’s like to hate this home, and I know what it’s like to love being in it. I know what it’s like to feel my body as a brutalist office building made of concrete walls and right angles, restrictions and doors where I didn’t know the entrance code. And I know what it’s like to be in my body as a cozy cabin on a lake.When I splash around a pool, more attentive to my soul’s elation than to the shape of my being in a bathing suit, I feel in touch with my human animal self, who experiences all the joys on earth through this natural, ever-changing body.\nAdvertisement\nFrom HOW TO BE A LIVING THING by Mari Andrew, published by Penguin Life, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC.

    "title": "How to harness your body clock for a longer  healt 20250804 060522",
    "content": "Advertisement\nYour circadian rhythm influences mood, metabolism and even how well you respond to medical treatment. Now we finally have the tools to harness it to help us live longer and feel better\nBy Linda Geddes\n28 July 2025\nNash Weerasekera\nNash Weerasekera\nSome people check a wristwatch; others use a smartphone app or the position of the sun. But although these methods will tell you what time it is, they won’t reveal your internal time – that is, the state of the clocks in your cells and tissues. This explains why I am standing in front of a mirror, plucking hairs from my head and plunging their bulbous roots into a small tube of buffer solution. Once the hairs have been analysed by a lab in Germany, I should discover what time it is inside my body.\nFor centuries, we have been missing a vital ingredient in health and medicine – the body clock. Over the past few decades, researchers have discovered that our mood, metabolism, athletic performance and cognitive capabilities vary over a 24-hour period, while a disrupted body clock is implicated in an ever-growing list of health conditions, from type 2 diabetes to cancer. It has also become clear that giving medications or interventions at different times of day can profoundly alter their efficacy and side effects, with more than half of drugs influenced by our internal time-of-day, or circadian, rhythms.\nYet, without a way to quickly and accurately read body clocks, our ability to capitalise on such insights is limited, which may even be harming us. A raft of tests now in development should change that, promising to help us understand our body clocks from a sample of saliva or blood, or even from hair cells like those I am sending to Germany. One of these tests is already on the market. Together, they could lead to a revolution in medicine.\nCircadian rhythms are natural oscillations in the activity of our tissues that are driven by an internal clock – or rather trillions of clocks, ticking in every cell of our bodies.\n“If you look at the expression of genes in different tissues, they’re all doing different things at different times of day, and what those genes are doing depends on the timing of the clocks in that tissue,” says Rosemary Braun at Northwestern University in Chicago.\nThese clocks are controlled by a set of clock genes that produce daily fluctuations in a handful of clock proteins, and these influence the activity of numerous other genes in turn. Indeed, in 2014, researchers led by John Hogenesch at the University of Pennsylvania discovered that 43 per cent of mice genes are expressed rhythmically. Moreover, the study revealed that 56 of the 100 best-selling drugs in the US, and a similar proportion of the World Health Organization’s essential medicines – drugs that are supposed to be in every hospital in the world – target proteins whose rhythms fluctuate over 24 hours.\nThese results support the idea of chronotherapy – giving drugs at the time of day they are most likely to be effective and least likely to trigger side effects. Some clinical evidence backs the approach too, with cancer medicine leading the way.\nFrancis Lévi at Paris-Saclay University, France, became interested in the idea of biological rhythms through traditional Chinese medicine, which describes the vitality of different organs peaking at various times of day. He began to investigate this in the context of cancer, recognising that while healthy cells usually only divide at certain times of day, cancer cells do so all the time. Because many chemotherapy drugs target rapidly dividing cells, he reasoned that giving these drugs when healthy cells are effectively asleep might allow larger doses to be delivered with fewer side effects.\nInitial experiments in mice confirmed this, followed by a small clinical trial in women with advanced ovarian cancer. Published in 1990, it suggested that side effects such as nausea and fatigue could be significantly reduced if the women received chemotherapy drugs at 6 am rather than at 6 pm.\nSince then, Lévi and others have conducted further chronotherapy trials with other drugs, in various types of cancer. According to a 2022 review of 18 such trials, most showed evidence of reduced toxicity, while the efficacy of the drugs was maintained.\nSimilar results are now being reported in other fields of medicine. For example, the heart may be better able to withstand surgery in the afternoon compared with the morning, and the seasonal flu vaccine generates four times as many antibodies if given between 9 am and 11 am compared with 6 hours later.\n“Not only is how the drugs hit their target influenced by the clock, but there’s also evidence that how they enter the body and how they are excreted differs by time of day,” says Robert Dallmann, director of the Patho-Physiological Molecular Clocks Lab at the University of Warwick, UK.\nEven so, “there have been some studies that did not show the expected benefit”, says Lévi. One explanation could be that each participant’s internal clock is set slightly differently. “Until now, chronotherapy has adapted treatment to an average circadian rhythm in a population of people,” he says. “But the timing of these rhythms can differ by up to 12 hours between patients.”\nPerhaps then, chronotherapy isn’t only about administering the right drug at the right time, but at the right time for each patient, says Angela Relógio at MSH Medical School Hamburg in Germany. “The problem is you need to be able to measure the [internal] time.”\nUntil now, the gold standard for assessing internal time has been to record when individuals start to release a hormone called melatonin from their pituitary gland, which usually happens about 2 to 3 hours before they naturally fall asleep. This nightly event is controlled by a central body clock in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), whose job it is to keep the billions of clocks in our tissues synchronised with each other – and with the time of day outside (see box).\nMelatonin’s release is thought to be one of these synchronising signals, helping the body transition into nighttime mode, so measuring the onset of this event is the metaphorical equivalent of listening for when a clock strikes midnight.\nUseful as it is to measure this “dim-light melatonin onset”, recording it is laborious. It requires blood or saliva samples to be taken every 30 minutes from late afternoon onwards, and because the release of melatonin is inhibited by bright light, the subject ideally needs to remain in a darkened room for the duration. The samples must then be sent to a laboratory for processing, so it can take days or weeks to find out someone’s internal time.\nThis difficulty of telling internal time has hindered scientific progress in circadian medicine. However, researchers have been working on alternatives. Given that the products of clock genes – and the genes they regulate – fluctuate at different times of day, scientists have been searching for proteins or other “biomarkers” in body fluids and tissues that could reliably infer somebody’s internal time.\nFor instance, Relógio is CEO of TimeTeller, a company that has developed a saliva-based test, while Hogenesch’s team is investigating skin-based circadian biomarkers. Other research teams – including one led by Braun and others led by Derk-Jan Dijk at the University of Surrey, UK, and by Christopher Depner at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City – are developing blood-based biomarker tests.\nFor now, however, the only analysis available to consumers like me is the hair test offered by German firm BodyClock. For €199, it examines the relative amounts of messenger RNA – the genetic template for protein production – being expressed by clock genes in the subject’s hair follicles at the time they were plucked from their head. Through comparison with when the resulting proteins are known to peak and trough in people on average, BodyClock’s algorithm calculates how far advanced or delayed someone’s internal clock is relative to this.\nSome people’s body clocks mean they prefer to go to sleep early and wake up earlyWirestock, Inc./Alamy\nSome people’s body clocks mean they prefer to go to sleep early and wake up early\nWirestock, Inc./Alamy\nMy test results suggest that I am an intermediate type, or “dove”, and that my body begins to ramp up melatonin release at around 9.30 pm. Roughly 2 hours later, its concentration hits a level where my body switches to sleep mode, meaning I should naturally become tired at around midnight. This is when BodyClock recommends that I try to start sleeping, and I should try to wake up at around 8 am.\nThe company also suggests that my optimal eating time is between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm – or 6.30 pm if I am trying to lose weight, as my body is best equipped earlier in the day to convert food to energy, and not store it as fat (see second box). Meanwhile, the best time for me to exercise if I wish to optimise strength or endurance is between 5.30 pm and 7.30 pm. This is because body temperature, blood flow and blood pressure gradually increase during the day, contributing to improved muscle performance in the early evening.\nAs the author of a book on circadian rhythms, I didn’t find any of this particularly surprising. It also fits with when I would naturally choose to go to bed and wake up, if not for the fact that I am forced to set my alarm clock to 7 am, to get my kids out of bed and off to school on weekdays.\nHowever, I am not really BodyClock’s target customer. Bert Maier, a chronobiologist at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany, who sits on the company’s scientific advisory board, says most people who buy the test have sleep problems. “Some types of insomnia are related to a disrupted circadian clock, and in this case, we might help customers to readjust their clock or inform them what they should do to enhance or strengthen it.”\nThe biomarker tests could also be useful in the context of clinical trials. Later this year, Lévi hopes to begin a chronotherapy trial that will see 242 people with non-small cell lung cancer receive immuno-chemotherapy. Although most will be randomly allocated to receive morning or afternoon treatment, a subgroup will have their internal rhythms assessed using TimeTeller’s saliva test to see if personalising the timing of these drugs could further boost their efficacy. In a recent trial, Lévi and his colleagues discovered that administering the treatment to people before 11.30 am was associated with a nearly twofold increase in overall survival from the cancer. “If we can double the survival of patients by treating them in the morning compared to the afternoon or evening, I’d expect that we should be able to at least further double this by personalising the time of administration,” says Lévi.\nThere is a third way in which biomarker tests could be helpful. Over the past decade, evidence has been building of the harm circadian disruption can have on people’s health, with links to psychiatric and neurological conditions, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Such disruption occurs when our internal clocks fall out of sync with one another, perhaps because of shiftwork, inappropriately timed light exposure or social jet lag caused by inconsistent bedtimes.\n“Circadian misalignment is very strongly linked with many of the health issues of modern society,” says Depner. “If we could measure biomarkers effectively, this would expand the populations that we can reach with our research. Most excitingly, we could use them on real-world shift workers to understand how their clocks are moving around with their different shift schedules. This could allow us to devise interventions to help mitigate the health risks.”\nFor instance, researchers are exploring whether restricting when people eat, or the type of light they are exposed to during night shifts, could help to mitigate some of the detrimental health effects of shiftwork.\nHowever, the tests that are currently available, or are being developed, are somewhat limited in what information they can provide, because samples must be sent to a laboratory for processing, rather than providing the results in real time.\nFor instance, BodyClock’s hair test currently takes five weeks to deliver results to customers, which is a potential problem because our “chronotype” isn’t entirely fixed, with the type and timing of light exposure being a major factor that can push or pull our internal clocks forwards and backwards. I previously conducted an experiment with Dijk that saw me cut out artificial light after dusk and expose myself to more natural light during the daytime. Doing so caused my body clock (as measured by my dim-light melatonin onset) to shift 2 hours earlier.\nA growing body of evidence indicates that our bodies are primed to process food more efficiently in the morningplainpicture/Saskia Sandrock\nA growing body of evidence indicates that our bodies are primed to process food more efficiently in the morning\nplainpicture/Saskia Sandrock\nSo, while BodyClock’s test results suggest my melatonin release significantly ramps up at 9.30 pm, this reflects my biology as it existed several weeks ago, which may not reflect my situation today, or another five weeks from now.\nSlightly out-of-date results may not matter if a doctor is simply trying to ascertain whether someone’s insomnia is related to a significantly advanced or delayed clock, or in the context of a clinical trial. However, the ability to deliver more instantaneous results could be useful for shift workers who would like to adapt to a new shift pattern, or frequent travellers who want to overcome jet lag more quickly.\nSay you had just flown from London to New York. “In the morning, you could pull a hair and run a test to find out the timing of your internal clock,” says Dijk. “You could then use this information to help you overcome your jet lag through timed light exposure or taking a melatonin pill.”\nWhy honing your sense of smell could keep you sharp as you ageA declining ability to detect scents is linked to conditions including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. But restoring our most neglected sense might not only reduce cognitive decline – studies also show it could even reverse it\nWhy honing your sense of smell could keep you sharp as you age\nA declining ability to detect scents is linked to conditions including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. But restoring our most neglected sense might not only reduce cognitive decline – studies also show it could even reverse it\nAnother useful add-on would be if biomarker tests could assess the timings of individual organs, and how closely aligned they are. Although our body clocks gradually adjust themselves to altered patterns of light exposure caused by changing shifts at work or time zones, they do so at different rates, which can result in our gut rhythms falling out of synchrony with those of our brain, and so on. This ongoing mismatch is suspected to be behind some of the adverse health effects that have been associated with shiftwork.\n“If there are molecular markers that reflect what’s going on in the liver, pancreas, muscle and all these other specific tissues, the question is: could we then use that information to try and devise interventions to help to better align them?” says Depner.\nIn other words, this first generation of body clock tests simply scratches the surface when it comes to reading the time inside us in a way that could usefully shape our lifestyles or improve healthcare. But researchers see the tests as a good start. If the past two decades have highlighted the importance of body clocks for human health, the hope is that the coming one will illuminate the cogs, levers and gears that we could pull to fine-tune their movements and keep all of us running on time.\nHow to shift your internal clock \n\n\nOur circadian rhythms are controlled by a small patch of brain tissue called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Although its timing is regulated by a network of “clock genes”, it is also influenced by our exposure to light, through conversations with a group of light-sensitive cells in the retina at the back of the eye.\nWhen light hits these retinal cells, they send a signal to the SCN, altering the expression of its clock genes and tweaking its timing. The retinal cells are particularly responsive to light in the blue part of the spectrum, which includes daylight. Their effect on the circadian system is also strongly time-dependent. For instance, exposure to light in the early evening and at night delays our central body clock, meaning we feel sleepy later, while exposure to light shortly after dawn advances our clock and makes us more lark-like – early to bed, early to rise.\nMelatonin supplements can also be used to alter the timing of the SCN. To advance your clock (waking and going to sleep earlier), you should take it roughly 4 to 6 hours before your normal bedtime. To delay your clock (go to bed and wake later), take it in the early morning, immediately after you wake up.\nOur circadian rhythms are controlled by a small patch of brain tissue called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

Mounting research suggests that our bodies may be primed to process food, especially carbohydrates, more efficiently in the morning compared with later in the day. Earlier on, our tissues are most sensitive to insulin, the hormone that helps to absorb sugar into cells.\nEating a large, carb-rich meal later in the day could lead to higher levels of glucose circulating in the blood, which, over time, could increase someone’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, a group of health issues that puts you at risk of various conditions including this form of diabetes.\nFurthermore, we may burn slightly more calories digesting food in the morning. Several small studies also indicate that evening snacks may reduce the amount of fat the body burns overnight, while eating earlier in the day boosts fat burning. Larger, longer-term studies are needed to determine how such findings relate to fat storage and weight change in the wider population, but it appears there is wisdom in the old saying: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper.”\nWhat if the timing of your meals mattered almost as much as what is on your plate?

Now we finally have the tools to harness it to help us live longer and feel better\nBy Linda Geddes\n28 July 2025\nNash Weerasekera\nNash Weerasekera\nSome people check a wristwatch; others use a smartphone app or the position of the sun. But although these methods will tell you what time it is, they won’t reveal your internal time – that is, the state of the clocks in your cells and tissues. This explains why I am standing in front of a mirror, plucking hairs from my head and plunging their bulbous roots into a small tube of buffer solution. Once the hairs have been analysed by a lab in Germany, I should discover what time it is inside my body.\nFor centuries, we have been missing a vital ingredient in health and medicine – the body clock. Over the past few decades, researchers have discovered that our mood, metabolism, athletic performance and cognitive capabilities vary over a 24-hour period, while a disrupted body clock is implicated in an ever-growing list of health conditions, from type 2 diabetes to cancer. It has also become clear that giving medications or interventions at different times of day can profoundly alter their efficacy and side effects, with more than half of drugs influenced by our internal time-of-day, or circadian, rhythms.\nYet, without a way to quickly and accurately read body clocks, our ability to capitalise on such insights is limited, which may even be harming us. A raft of tests now in development should change that, promising to help us understand our body clocks from a sample of saliva or blood, or even from hair cells like those I am sending to Germany. One of these tests is already on the market. Together, they could lead to a revolution in medicine.\nCircadian rhythms are natural oscillations in the activity of our tissues that are driven by an internal clock – or rather trillions of clocks, ticking in every cell of our bodies.\n“If you look at the expression of genes in different tissues, they’re all doing different things at different times of day, and what those genes are doing depends on the timing of the clocks in that tissue,” says Rosemary Braun at Northwestern University in Chicago.\nThese clocks are controlled by a set of clock genes that produce daily fluctuations in a handful of clock proteins, and these influence the activity of numerous other genes in turn. Indeed, in 2014, researchers led by John Hogenesch at the University of Pennsylvania discovered that 43 per cent of mice genes are expressed rhythmically. Moreover, the study revealed that 56 of the 100 best-selling drugs in the US, and a similar proportion of the World Health Organization’s essential medicines – drugs that are supposed to be in every hospital in the world – target proteins whose rhythms fluctuate over 24 hours.\nThese results support the idea of chronotherapy – giving drugs at the time of day they are most likely to be effective and least likely to trigger side effects. Some clinical evidence backs the approach too, with cancer medicine leading the way.\nFrancis Lévi at Paris-Saclay University, France, became interested in the idea of biological rhythms through traditional Chinese medicine, which describes the vitality of different organs peaking at various times of day. He began to investigate this in the context of cancer, recognising that while healthy cells usually only divide at certain times of day, cancer cells do so all the time. Because many chemotherapy drugs target rapidly dividing cells, he reasoned that giving these drugs when healthy cells are effectively asleep might allow larger doses to be delivered with fewer side effects.\nInitial experiments in mice confirmed this, followed by a small clinical trial in women with advanced ovarian cancer. Published in 1990, it suggested that side effects such as nausea and fatigue could be significantly reduced if the women received chemotherapy drugs at 6 am rather than at 6 pm.\nSince then, Lévi and others have conducted further chronotherapy trials with other drugs, in various types of cancer. According to a 2022 review of 18 such trials, most showed evidence of reduced toxicity, while the efficacy of the drugs was maintained.\nSimilar results are now being reported in other fields of medicine. For example, the heart may be better able to withstand surgery in the afternoon compared with the morning, and the seasonal flu vaccine generates four times as many antibodies if given between 9 am and 11 am compared with 6 hours later.\n“Not only is how the drugs hit their target influenced by the clock, but there’s also evidence that how they enter the body and how they are excreted differs by time of day,” says Robert Dallmann, director of the Patho-Physiological Molecular Clocks Lab at the University of Warwick, UK.\nEven so, “there have been some studies that did not show the expected benefit”, says Lévi.

Larger, longer-term studies are needed to determine how such findings relate to fat storage and weight change in the wider population, but it appears there is wisdom in the old saying: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper.”\nLinda Geddes is the author of Chasing the Sun: The new science of sunlight and how it shapes our bodies and minds\nTopics:\nAdvertisement\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! \n            We'll also keep you up to date with New Scientist \n            events and special offers.\nExplore the latest news, articles and features\nNews\nNews\nNews\nLeader\nTrending New Scientist articles\nAdvertisement\nDownload the app",

The move is an attempt by the government to address the country’s growing number of retractions due to misconduct.\nThese universities have the most retracted scientific articles\nThese universities have the most retracted scientific articles\nMany retractions correct honest mistakes in the literature, but others arise because of misconduct. India has had more papers retracted than any country apart from China and the United States, according to an analysis of the public database maintained by Retraction Watch of retractions over the past three decades.\nBut whereas less than 1 paper is retracted for every 1,000 papers published in the United States, more than 3 are retracted for every 1,000 published in China, and the figure is 2 per 1,000 in India. The majority in India and China are withdrawn because of misconduct or research-integrity concerns.\nRetractions are “a very important signal of misconduct, and we should be looking closely at them now”, says Achal Agrawal, a data scientist in Raipur, India, who was involved in the analysis. Agrawal is founder of India Research Watch, an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues.\nSome researchers have welcomed the government’s decision, calling it a first step in acknowledging and attempting to tackle the problem. But others warn that retractions are a way for science to self-correct and should not be penalized.\nThe policy’s effectiveness will depend on how exactly institutional retractions are measured and penalized — details that will be revealed only when the latest ranking results are announced, in a couple of weeks.\n“I hope that the penalty is strong enough to act as a deterrent, and it doesn’t remain symbolic,” says Agrawal.\nMoumita Koley, who studies metascience at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, also appreciates the policy. “Indian science needs a little clean-up, and this shows that people have taken note,” she says. But she worries that the situation won’t change for the better.

It takes into account factors including teaching, engagement and research-impact metrics such as publication and citation counts.\n“It’s the most important ranking in India,” says Agrawal.

A high rank confers some advantages, including permission to design their own curriculum.\nBut the growing number of retractions in India and globally has not gone unnoticed, says Anil Sahasrabudhe, who chairs the National Board of Accreditation in New Delhi, which conducts the national ranking. A 2025 analysis by Nature found that several Indian institutions were among the top global institutions with the most retracted papers in the past five years.\nThe board decided to deduct marks as a way to ‘name and shame’ institutions, and send the message that unethical research practices are not acceptable, says Sahasrabudhe. Because this year will be the first in which the assessment considers retractions, penalties will be mild and symbolic for now, he says.\nThe NIRF will count the number of research papers retracted in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for each institution over the past three years, he says. A small number of retractions is acceptable, but generally, “the more number of retractions, the more the penalty”. Institutions that consistently get many retractions could be penalized more over time and might even be barred from the ranking, he says. Sahasrabudhe acknowledges that retractions sometimes occur for reasons beyond a researcher’s control, but when they happen in large numbers, “they are not necessarily by error but deliberate, hence need to be punished to send a strong signal.”\nResearchers say the assessment should also consider retractions recorded in the public database maintained by Retraction Watch, which is more comprehensive than Scopus or Web of Science and includes the reasons for retractions. Sahasrabudhe says they wanted to use the same source for retractions as they use for publications and citations.\nResearchers also say the ranking should penalize only those retractions that are attributable to plagiarism, fraud or other research-integrity issues — and should look for patterns of bad behaviour, as opposed to one-offs.\nor\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-02364-6\nReprints and permissions\nThese universities have the most retracted scientific articles\nRetractions caused by honest mistakes are extremely stressful, say researchers\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\nBiomedical paper retractions have quadrupled in 20 years — why?\nRetractions are part of science, but misconduct isn’t — lessons from a superconductivity lab\nChina conducts first nationwide review of retractions and research misconduct\nAI models are neglecting African languages — scientists want to change that\nNews 29 JUL 25\nMeet Aeneas: the AI that can fill in the gaps of damaged Latin texts\nNews 23 JUL 25\nEncouraging a ‘data sufficiency’ mindset is key for responsible research\nCorrespondence 22 JUL 25\nScientific bedlam at the world’s weirdest and wildest research conference\nCareer Feature 30 JUL 25\nShould I tell anyone that I suspect misconduct in a paper I’m reviewing?\nCareer Feature 18 JUL 25\nScientists hide messages in papers to game AI peer review\nNews 11 JUL 25\nScientific bedlam at the world’s weirdest and wildest research conference\nCareer Feature 30 JUL 25\nFrom bench to big boss: mitigating the widening gap between PI and lab\nCareer Column 30 JUL 25\nSleuths and scientific institutions are not rivals\nEditorial 30 JUL 25\nPostdoc opportunity to engage in both foundational machine learning research and high-impact interdisciplinary applications in the life sciences.\nVienna, Austria\nAITHYRA GmbH - Research Institute for Biomedical Artificial Intelligence of the Austrian Academy of Sciences\nShenzhen, Guangdong (CN)\nShenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation\nShenzhen, Guangdong (CN)\nShenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation\nThe Carol and Gene Ludwig Program for the Study of Neuroimmune Interactions in Dementia at Yale School of Medicine seeks new tenure-track faculty.\nNew Haven, Connecticut\nYale School of Medicine - Ludwig Program for the Study of Neuroimmune Interaction in Dementia\n6 major schools are now hiring faculty members.\nShanghai, China\nShanghaiTech University\nThese universities have the most retracted scientific articles\nRetractions caused by honest mistakes are extremely stressful, say researchers\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\nBiomedical paper retractions have quadrupled in 20 years — why?\nRetractions are part of science, but misconduct isn’t — lessons from a superconductivity lab\nChina conducts first nationwide review of retractions and research misconduct\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your inbox every weekday.\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter — what matters in science, free to your inbox daily.\nNature\n                    \n                    (Nature)\nISSN 1476-4687 (online)\nISSN 0028-0836 (print)\n© 2025 Springer Nature Limited",

    "content": "Correspondent\nCorrespondent\nWelcome back to In the Loop, TIME’s new twice-weekly newsletter about AI. Starting today, we’ll be publishing these editions both as stories on Time.com and as emails. If you're reading this in your browser, why not subscribe to have the next one delivered straight to your inbox?\nSubscribe to In the Loop\nIf you talk to staff at the top AI labs, you’ll hear a lot of stories about how the future could go fantastically well—or terribly badly. And of all the ways that AI might cause harm to the human race, there’s one that scientists in the industry are particularly worried about today. That’s the possibility of AI helping bad actors to start a new pandemic. “You could try to synthesize something like COVID or a more dangerous version of the flu—and basically, our modeling suggests that this might be possible,” Anthropic’s chief scientist, Jared Kaplan, told me in May.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nMeasuring the risk — In a new study published this morning, and shared exclusively with TIME ahead of its release, we got the first hard numbers on how experts think the risk of a new pandemic might have increased thanks to AI. The Forecasting Research Institute polled experts earlier this year, asking them how likely a human-caused pandemic might be—and how likely it might become if humans had access to AI that could reliably give advice on how to build a bioweapon.\nWhat they found — Experts, who were polled between December and February, put the risk of a human-caused pandemic at 0.3% per year.

Credit: Brenda Namumba\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital-development programme to develop the talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\nNow, the SKA is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and radioastronomy students at African universities and institutions.\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to boost Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the last of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Brenda Namumba, who was the first woman to receive a doctorate in astrophysics in Zambia, talks about how networks built her career.\nI only found out about astronomy back in 2009, as an undergraduate studying physics, when I happened to attend an international conference on space science and astronomy at the University of Zambia in Lusaka. That was the first time I heard about young people studying space science and astronomy at the master’s or PhD level. Back then, I had not even met anyone from Zambia doing a master’s in physics.\nAt the meeting, I interacted with established scholars and graduate students, who told me about their research and what they wanted to do in future. We kept in touch and some of them helped me to apply for scholarships and explained how to write a personal statement.\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\nThe conference made me decide to further my studies, and I applied for many scholarships while working as a secondary-school physics and mathematics teacher. Eventually, in 2012, I was accepted into South Africa’s National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP) as an honours undergraduate student at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This scholarship programme, established in 2003, has supported more than 300 honours-degree students and more than 140 master’s candidates.\nThe programme introduced me to the idea that astronomers can make use of a range of electromagnetic wavelengths. In 2012, there was a lot of talk about the exciting science that was going to happen with the SKA. That was the year when it was decided to split the telescope between South Africa and Australia. South Africa had built the 7-dish KAT-7 radio telescope, which was the test bed for its 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope that will eventually form part of the SKA. I wanted to be at the forefront of answering some of the interesting questions that these radio instruments would make it possible to tackle.\nOne topic in particular caught my attention. During my honour’s degree, I took a course in extragalactic astronomy in which the lecturer (who later became my PhD supervisor) talked about dwarf galaxies. At the time, they hadn’t been explored in much detail with optical telescopes because they are faint and difficult to detect, and the situation was even worse at radio wavelengths. But, the new generation of instruments, such as KAT-7, was better suited to exploring their structure and properties to understand galaxy evolution. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) funded my master’s degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 2013, my doctorate at the UCT in 2015, and then my first postdoc at Rhodes University in Makhanda from 2019 to 2022.\nSARAO gave me this great opportunity, and it wasn’t solely about my academic qualifications. I’ve been able to attend conferences around the world, which have given me a different mindset concerning how people do research, and also confidence in presenting my work. For example, at the SARAO Postgraduate and Postdoctoral Research Conference, the organizers, who include SARAO staff and researchers from universities across South Africa, guide us in how to present our work and interact with colleagues and experts.\nor\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-02222-5\nDeveloping astronomers in Africa: ‘We wanted to create a discipline’\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\nGiant radio telescope was ‘a natural magnet’ for African talent\nMy AI chatbot thinks my idea is fundable\nCareer Column 31 JUL 25\nFrom bench to big boss: mitigating the widening gap between PI and lab\nCareer Column 30 JUL 25\nHow China’s bold talent recruitment has shaped science\nNews 29 JUL 25\nLava planets’ atmospheres give away what lies beneath\nResearch Highlight 30 JUL 25\nWhy space foods aren’t just for space\nComment 28 JUL 25\nSpain bids €400 million to host mega telescope at risk in US budget cuts\nNews 24 JUL 25\nResearchers in dismay as US exits world science body UNESCO … again\nNews 23 JUL 25\nClass of 2025: five PhD students reveal realigned priorities in wake of COVID and cuts\nCareer Feature 18 JUL 25\nBring science into business schools to train the leaders of tomorrow\nWorld View 15 JUL 25\nPostdoc opportunity to engage in both foundational machine learning research and high-impact interdisciplinary applications in the life sciences.\nVienna, Austria\nAITHYRA GmbH - Research Institute for Biomedical Artificial Intelligence of the Austrian Academy of Sciences\nShenzhen, Guangdong (CN)\nShenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation\nShenzhen, Guangdong (CN)\nShenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation\nThe Carol and Gene Ludwig Program for the Study of Neuroimmune Interactions in Dementia at Yale School of Medicine seeks new tenure-track faculty.\nNew Haven, Connecticut\nYale School of Medicine - Ludwig Program for the Study of Neuroimmune Interaction in Dementia\n6 major schools are now hiring faculty members.\nShanghai, China\nShanghaiTech University\nDeveloping astronomers in Africa: ‘We wanted to create a discipline’\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\nGiant radio telescope was ‘a natural magnet’ for African talent\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your inbox every weekday.\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter — what matters in science, free to your inbox daily.\nNature\n                    \n                    (Nature)\nISSN 1476-4687 (online)\nISSN 0028-0836 (print)\n© 2025 Springer Nature Limited",

Credit: Brenda Namumba\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital-development programme to develop the talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\nNow, the SKA is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and radioastronomy students at African universities and institutions.\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to boost Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.

That was the first time I heard about young people studying space science and astronomy at the master’s or PhD level. Back then, I had not even met anyone from Zambia doing a master’s in physics.\nAt the meeting, I interacted with established scholars and graduate students, who told me about their research and what they wanted to do in future. We kept in touch and some of them helped me to apply for scholarships and explained how to write a personal statement.\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\nThe conference made me decide to further my studies, and I applied for many scholarships while working as a secondary-school physics and mathematics teacher. Eventually, in 2012, I was accepted into South Africa’s National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP) as an honours undergraduate student at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This scholarship programme, established in 2003, has supported more than 300 honours-degree students and more than 140 master’s candidates.\nThe programme introduced me to the idea that astronomers can make use of a range of electromagnetic wavelengths. In 2012, there was a lot of talk about the exciting science that was going to happen with the SKA. That was the year when it was decided to split the telescope between South Africa and Australia. South Africa had built the 7-dish KAT-7 radio telescope, which was the test bed for its 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope that will eventually form part of the SKA. I wanted to be at the forefront of answering some of the interesting questions that these radio instruments would make it possible to tackle.\nOne topic in particular caught my attention. During my honour’s degree, I took a course in extragalactic astronomy in which the lecturer (who later became my PhD supervisor) talked about dwarf galaxies. At the time, they hadn’t been explored in much detail with optical telescopes because they are faint and difficult to detect, and the situation was even worse at radio wavelengths. But, the new generation of instruments, such as KAT-7, was better suited to exploring their structure and properties to understand galaxy evolution. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) funded my master’s degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 2013, my doctorate at the UCT in 2015, and then my first postdoc at Rhodes University in Makhanda from 2019 to 2022.\nSARAO gave me this great opportunity, and it wasn’t solely about my academic qualifications.

    "content": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ernest Ang, the 24-year-old founder of Kokoyo Nyonya Delights, a Peranakan eatery in Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhen I was younger, I wasn't allowed in the kitchen alone. My family always feared I'd burn it down.\nSo when I told my grandmother that I wanted to start my own restaurant, she thought it was just another one of my crazy ideas — I'd had many growing up.\nI've always loved my grandmother's food. She used to run a hawker stall selling Peranakan food.\nPeranakan people like me have mixed Chinese and Malay ancestry, so our food is a fusion of Malay, Chinese, and Indian flavors. It's very strong in flavor and very fragrant.\nLast year, I started my own Peranakan food business, battling high rents, difficulty getting customers, and getting used to sweating in a kitchen for hours. I never looked back.\nI did an electronics engineering diploma, but realized I hated the idea of being an engineer. I didn't know what job to pursue, but I knew what I didn't want to do — engineering.\nI tried looking for work in human resources and administrative roles, but I knew that wasn't what I was cut out for.\nMy friends recommended I try something different because my grandma is a good cook, and I love to cook.\nI decided to take a stab at it.\nMy grandma is very secretive about her recipes. To her, they're like an asset.\nWhen I told her that I wanted to start my own restaurant, she thought I wasn't committed to it and that I would give up after a month or two.\nFor months, I went to her house with ingredients, trying to watch how she cooked and take notes. This was a challenging process because she measured ingredients based on gut feeling.\nI finally managed to figure out her recipes and develop a process for cooking for a restaurant.\nI launched Kokoyo Nyonya Delights in August, after months of practising recipes and an SG$80,000, or about $62,000, investment. I rented a small open-air eatery in Singapore's northwestern Serangoon neighborhood for SG$13,500 a month.\nThree of my friends helped me out with cooking and operations.\nMy grandmother contributed some of her savings. I couldn't have done it without her investment.\nI started with 12 items on the menu, which included soups, vegetable dishes, and some meat dishes.\nMy grandmother told me to focus on the most popular Peranakan dishes, like inchi kabin, a fried chicken dish, and beef rendang, which is beef stewed in coconut milk and spices. Babi pongteh, which is braised pork in soybean sauce, is also one of our favorites.\nEverything served at Kokoyo Nyonya has to be vetted by my grandmother. I'm not a certified chef. I don't have a culinary background — I only have my grandma.\nCooking Peranakan food is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. I get in at around 9 a.m. every day to make everything from scratch, because grandma doesn't like me selling leftovers. I leave after 9 p.m. after feeding the dinner crowd.\nThere's a lot of prep involved. Based on my grandma's recipe, just cooking our rice is a 23-step, three-hour-long process.\nWhile the first few weeks of operations were smooth, the real challenge came after we had an article written about us, and we started seeing a wave of customers.\nThe crowd was overwhelming, and I realized we couldn't cope with it. That's when I had to abandon some of the things my grandma told me to do, like ditching a wok in favor of a deep fryer to fry chicken.\nBut less than a year after I opened in Serangoon, I had to move. My rent was also too high: SG$13,500 monthly. I couldn't afford it.\nAnd there were a lot of older people in the neighborhood where I opened my restaurant. I found that they weren't too willing to spend a lot of money on food.\nIn July, I moved to a smaller stall in a food court near Singapore's Sixth Avenue, a wealthy neighborhood where people are willing to spend more.\nRent here is much cheaper. I pay exactly half of what I did in my earlier location. I've also reduced the number of staff members from four to two.\nAt first, I wasn't used to the long days in the kitchen. I was sweaty and grumpy.\nBut I later accepted that that's what life as a restaurant owner is like. I work seven days a week, which doesn't leave time for much else. I haven't met my friends in a while, unless they come to see me.\nBut I like that it's not a repetitive job. Every day comes with a new problem, be it difficult customers or problems with staff.\nI don't have regrets about trying to start something of my own.\nJump to",

    "content": "Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\" and they must be released \"unconditionally\".\nThe calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.\nIsraeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.\nHamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\nReports from Gaza say Palestinians desperately seeking aid near distribution points came under fire from Israeli troops at two different locations on Sunday. At least 27 Palestinians were killed, hospitals in Gaza say.\nThe Israeli hostages Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were abducted from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel. \nThey are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.\nAfter the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\". \nThe charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.\nHamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.\nThe Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.\nEarlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones. \nThere has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023. \nAt the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages. \nDavid and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"\nIn one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".\nBraslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\n\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.\nIn the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.\nHis family said he was being \"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\".\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \"appalled\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \"abject cruelty\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.\nHe said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.\nThe images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.\nThe UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.\nSome pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.\nAs the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage. \nPolls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

    "content": "Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\" and they must be released \"unconditionally\".\nThe calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.\nIsraeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.\nHamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\nReports from Gaza say Palestinians desperately seeking aid near distribution points came under fire from Israeli troops at two different locations on Sunday. At least 27 Palestinians were killed, hospitals in Gaza say.\nThe Israeli hostages Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were abducted from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.\nThey are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.\nAfter the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\".\nThe charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.\nHamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.\nThe Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.\nEarlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.\nThere has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.\nAt the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.\nDavid and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"\nIn one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".\nBraslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\n\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.\nIn the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.\nHis family said he was being \"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\".\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \"appalled\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \"abject cruelty\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.\nHe said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.\nThe images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.\nThe UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.\nSome pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.\nAs the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.\nPolls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Listed  Ten most  AI exposed  jobs AND the roles h 20250804 060419",
    "content": "One in ten graduates have already altered their career plans due to fears that artificial intelligence (AI) will jeopardise their job prospects. University leavers aiming for careers in graphic design, coding, film and art are particularly worried about the impact of AI, with many fearing the rapidly evolving technology could make their jobs redundant.\nThese concerns arise as Britain's job market continues to cool, with firms cutting back on recruitment and increasing redundancies in response to the Chancellor's National Insurance increase and a rise in the minimum wage. According to a survey of 4,072 individuals by university and career advisers Prospects, 10 percent stated they had changed their career plans because of AI, a figure that rises to 11 percent among graduates.\nThe primary reason given was worry that their chosen jobs could become redundant. Opportunities in the creative industries were highlighted as being particularly at risk from AI's rapid progression.\nChris Rea from Prospects noted that while many graduates are avoiding certain careers due to AI, others are exploring new industries because of the opportunities the technology offers, reports the Express.\nJeremy Swan, from the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, said technological advances are forcing graduates to seek roles where they cannot be easily substituted by AI.\nHe stated: \"I think it's about re-framing people's thinking, so that they can see there are opportunities out there that look slightly different than what they're used to.\"\nMr Swan said AI has left many students and graduates feeling \"really uncertain about where they stand\".\nData from job search platform Adzuna reveals entry-level positions have plummeted by 32 percent since Chat GPT launched in November 2022.\nMr Swan added: \"There's a lot of uncertainty that's come off the back of AI, people worrying how it's going to affect their chosen career paths, and we would just say this is where decent career support matters more than ever.\"\nLogging equipment operators.\nMotorboat operators.\nOrderlies.\nFloor sanders and finishers.\nPile driver operators.\nRail-track laying and maintenance equipment.\nFoundry moulders and coremakers.\nWater treatment plant and system operators.\nBridge and lock tenders.\nDredge operators.\nInterpreters and translators.\nHistorians.\nPassenger attendants.\nSales representatives of services.\nWriters and authors.\nCustomer service representatives.\nCNC tool programmers.\nTelephone operators.\nTicket agents and travel clerks.\nBroadcast announcers and radio DJs.\nRecruitment has declined LinkedIn data reveals that UK hiring dropped by 6.7 percent in June compared to May, following a 3.9 percent increase the previous month. Official statistics also show that unemployment rose to a four-year high of 4.7 percent in the three months leading up to May.\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey recently suggested that larger interest rate cuts may be necessary if the jobs market continues to slow down. City traders predict rates could be reduced from 4.25 percent to 4 percent at Thursday's Monetary Policy Committee meeting.\nUniversity graduates are now facing an increasingly challenging job market as employers reduce graduate recruitment.

    "content": "One in ten graduates have already altered their career plans due to fears that artificial intelligence (AI) will jeopardise their job prospects. University leavers aiming for careers in graphic design, coding, film and art are particularly worried about the impact of AI, with many fearing the rapidly evolving technology could make their jobs redundant.\nThese concerns arise as Britain's job market continues to cool, with firms cutting back on recruitment and increasing redundancies in response to the Chancellor's National Insurance increase and a rise in the minimum wage. According to a survey of 4,072 individuals by university and career advisers Prospects, 10 percent stated they had changed their career plans because of AI, a figure that rises to 11 percent among graduates.\nThe primary reason given was worry that their chosen jobs could become redundant. Opportunities in the creative industries were highlighted as being particularly at risk from AI's rapid progression.\nChris Rea from Prospects noted that while many graduates are avoiding certain careers due to AI, others are exploring new industries because of the opportunities the technology offers, reports the Express.\nJeremy Swan, from the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, said technological advances are forcing graduates to seek roles where they cannot be easily substituted by AI.\nHe stated: \"I think it's about re-framing people's thinking, so that they can see there are opportunities out there that look slightly different than what they're used to.\"\nMr Swan said AI has left many students and graduates feeling \"really uncertain about where they stand\".\nData from job search platform Adzuna reveals entry-level positions have plummeted by 32 percent since Chat GPT launched in November 2022.\nMr Swan added: \"There's a lot of uncertainty that's come off the back of AI, people worrying how it's going to affect their chosen career paths, and we would just say this is where decent career support matters more than ever.\"\nLogging equipment operators.\nMotorboat operators.\nOrderlies.\nFloor sanders and finishers.\nPile driver operators.\nRail-track laying and maintenance equipment.\nFoundry moulders and coremakers.\nWater treatment plant and system operators.\nBridge and lock tenders.\nDredge operators.\nInterpreters and translators.\nHistorians.\nPassenger attendants.\nSales representatives of services.\nWriters and authors.\nCustomer service representatives.\nCNC tool programmers.\nTelephone operators.\nTicket agents and travel clerks.\nBroadcast announcers and radio DJs.\nRecruitment has declined LinkedIn data reveals that UK hiring dropped by 6.7 percent in June compared to May, following a 3.9 percent increase the previous month. Official statistics also show that unemployment rose to a four-year high of 4.7 percent in the three months leading up to May.\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey recently suggested that larger interest rate cuts may be necessary if the jobs market continues to slow down. City traders predict rates could be reduced from 4.25 percent to 4 percent at Thursday's Monetary Policy Committee meeting.\nUniversity graduates are now facing an increasingly challenging job market as employers reduce graduate recruitment. Data from Adzuna shows that graduate job listings have plummeted by nearly 23 percent in the year to April as rising taxes lead businesses to cut back on entry-level hiring.\nMeanwhile, increases to the national living wage mean many graduate schemes now only offer salaries equivalent to the minimum wage, which is currently £12.21 per hour or £25,500 a year for full-time workers.\nMajor employer KPMG has reduced its recruitment scheme, hiring just 942 graduates and school leavers last year compared with 1,399 in 2023.

Her efficiency often kept the station running in the face of others' incompetence.\nThe role earned Anderson two Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.\nAnderson starred on the big screen alongside Burt Reynolds in the 1983 comedy \"Stroker Ace,\" and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before their messy breakup in 1994.\nTheir son, Quinton Reynolds, was \"the best decision that we ever made in our entire relationship,\" she said during the unveiling of a bronze bust at Reynolds' Hollywood grave site in 2021.\n\"I think back to the beginning of our relationship, it was so, oh, gosh, tabloidy. We were just a spectacle all the time. And it was hard to have a relationship in that atmosphere. And somehow, we did it through many ups and downs,\" Anderson told The Associated Press.\nAnderson detailed their tumultuous marriage in the 1995 autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels,\" which she said was about \"the growth of a woman, a woman who survives.\"\n\"I think if you're going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,\" Anderson told the AP while promoting the book. \"You may not even tell the nicest things about yourself, because you're telling the truth.\"\nShe married four times, most recently to Bob Flick in 2008.\nAnderson was born Aug. 5, 1945, in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her father was an environmental chemist, and her mother was a model.\nHer first role as an actress was a small part in the 1966 film \"Nevada Smith,\" starring Steve McQueen. Most of her career was spent on the small screen with early guest parts in the 1970s on \"S.W.A.T.\" and \"Police Woman.\" After \"WKRP,\" Anderson starred in the short-lived comedy series \"Easy Street\" and appeared in made-for-TV movies including \"A Letter to Three Wives\" and \"White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd.\"\nIn 2023 she co-starred in Lifetime's \"Ladies Of The 80s: A Divas Christmas\" with Linda Gray, Donna Mills, Morgan Fairchild and Nicollette Sheridan.\n\"I am heartbroken to hear of the passing of the wonderful Loni Anderson!\" Fairchild wrote on X. \"The sweetest, most gracious lady! I'm just devastated to hear this.\"\nAnderson is survived by Flick, her daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and wife Helene, and step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.\nA private family service is planned at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Kagan said.\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor",

    "content": "While President Donald Trump's tariff war aims to spark a manufacturing boom at home, corporate America's spending focus remains firmly on \"bits\" rather than \"bricks and mortar.\"\nThis contrast is evident in the spending patterns of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks – a group comprising large-cap tech companies, including Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (parent company of Facebook and Instagram), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nThese firms are expected to cumulatively spend an astonishing $650 billion this year on capital expenditure (capex) and research and development (R&D), according to data tracked by Lloyds Bank. That amount is larger than what the U.K. government spends on public investments in a year, the bank noted in a Thursday note.\nIf that number alone doesn't impress you, consider this: the total economy-wide investment spending on IT equipment and software has continued to surge this year, accounting for 6.1% of GDP, while both private fixed and fixed non-residential investment, excluding IT, have shrunk for consecutive quarters.\nAccording to Lloyds' FX Strategist Nicholas Kennedy, the decline in investments across other sectors of the economy could be due to several reasons, including the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\"There might be some explanations other than a crowding out by IT spending and political/trade uncertainties that you could call on; the building boom that was triggered by Biden's CHIPS act, which boosted structures, has faded, for instance. There is also a FOMO effect at work, firms encouraged to divert investment resources from what they traditionally do towards fashionable AI-related projects. So they're just spending elsewhere,\" Kennedy said in a note to clients.\nThe chart indicates that U.S. corporate spending on IT equipment and software has increased to $1.45 trillion, representing a 13.6% year-over-year rise. The tally makes up over 40% of the total U.S. private fixed investment.\nThe U.S. second-quarter GDP estimate, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis early this week, showed that private fixed investment in IT increased by 12.4% quarter-on-quarter.\nMeanwhile, investment in non-IT sectors or the broader economy fell by 4.9%, extending the three-quarter declining trend.\nThis continued dominance of \"bits\" spending in corporate America should calm the nerves of those worried that the administration's focus on manufacturing may suck capital away from technology markets, including emerging avenues like cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin and NVDA, the bellwether for all things AI, both bottomed out in late November 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT and have since enjoyed incredible bull runs, demonstrating a powerful correlation between technology's rise and the crypto market.\n\"Whether that [AI spending boom] generates a return is another matter, but it does reshape plans towards bits from bricks,\" Kennedy said.\nMoreover, the crypto market has also found a significant tailwind in the form of a favourable regulatory policy under Trump. The administration has demonstrated its pro-crypto bias through the signing of several key pieces of legislation aimed at clarifying regulatory oversight for digital assets and stablecoins, including measures that have garnered bipartisan support. Additionally, the administration has made strategic appointments to financial regulatory bodies.\nOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor and analyst on CoinDesk's Markets team.

    "title": "Man gets jail  caning for sexually assaulting 11 y 20250804 060707",
    "content": "Singapore\nSingapore\nThe entrance of the Supreme Court in Singapore.\nSINGAPORE: A 34-year-old man was sentenced on Monday (Sep 5) to 20 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane after sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and giving her drugs.\nMuhammad Hisham Abdul Karim \"trawled the Internet\" before zeroing in on a primary school student and befriending her via Instagram, the court heard.\nHe later sexually assaulted her multiple times and gave her Ice – the street name for methamphetamine – to smoke in the back of a lorry.\nHisham pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault by penetration of a minor, with another 11 charges taken into consideration.\nThe court heard that Hisham viewed the Instagram profile of the victim, who was then 11, around May 2017. The victim was a primary school student and made reference to her school in her Instagram biography. She also posted photos of herself wearing her school jersey.\nHisham sent her a friend request and began chatting with her. When the victim viewed Hisham's Instagram account, she noticed that he had also followed several of her school friends.\nHisham met the victim at a staircase landing in a building sometime before mid-November 2017, according to court documents.\nAt the staircase landing, he kissed the victim and committed sex acts on her. They met up again that year, with Hisham picking the girl up in his motorcycle before heading to an open-air car park around Woodlands.\nHe got the girl to board the back of a covered lorry belonging to a company he worked for, before joining her.\nThey chatted in the back of the lorry, and Hisham produced a white crystalline substance, telling her it was Ice, a street name for meth. He also gave her a glass ball with a rubber tube and told her to smoke it.\nShe did so, and Hisham committed sex acts on her before sending her home.\nTheir relationship later soured and they stopped contacting each other. The offences came to light in February 2020, when the victim attended a session with a case worker and revealed that she had sex with Hisham in 2017.\nA police report was lodged and Hisham was arrested.\nThe court heard that he was previously convicted in 2016 of one count of sexual penetration of a minor and was sentenced to 10 months' jail.\nJustice Mavis Chionh noted that the victim in the latest case was a vulnerable one, and the offences were \"clearly premeditated and deviously planned\".\nShe said Hisham \"trawled the Internet\" and \"zeroed in on the victim and her primary school friends on Instagram\" before initiating contact. He knew \"full well\" that she was a primary school student, said the judge.\nGiving the girl a drug to consume was an aggravating factor as it would have rendered her more vulnerable, said Justice Chionh.\nHisham also exposed her to the grave risk of sexually transmitted diseases. He admitted to a psychiatrist that he frequented sex workers from 2013 to 2018.\nThe judge disagreed with the starting point of 11 years' jail per proceeded charge, saying it should be higher. She noted that the punishment Hisham received in 2016 for his previous crime \"did not teach him anything\".\nA psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health examined Hisham and found that he met the criteria for paedophilic disorder, with a moderate overall risk of sexual reoffending and an \"alarming clear escalation\" in the chronicity of his sexual offences.\nFor sexual assault by penetration of a minor under 16, he could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years' jail, and given at least 12 strokes of the cane.\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nCopyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "content": "Singapore\nSingapore\nThe entrance of the Supreme Court in Singapore.\nSINGAPORE: A 34-year-old man was sentenced on Monday (Sep 5) to 20 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane after sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and giving her drugs.\nMuhammad Hisham Abdul Karim \"trawled the Internet\" before zeroing in on a primary school student and befriending her via Instagram, the court heard.\nHe later sexually assaulted her multiple times and gave her Ice – the street name for methamphetamine – to smoke in the back of a lorry.\nHisham pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault by penetration of a minor, with another 11 charges taken into consideration.\nThe court heard that Hisham viewed the Instagram profile of the victim, who was then 11, around May 2017. The victim was a primary school student and made reference to her school in her Instagram biography. She also posted photos of herself wearing her school jersey.\nHisham sent her a friend request and began chatting with her. When the victim viewed Hisham's Instagram account, she noticed that he had also followed several of her school friends.\nHisham met the victim at a staircase landing in a building sometime before mid-November 2017, according to court documents.\nAt the staircase landing, he kissed the victim and committed sex acts on her. They met up again that year, with Hisham picking the girl up in his motorcycle before heading to an open-air car park around Woodlands.\nHe got the girl to board the back of a covered lorry belonging to a company he worked for, before joining her.\nThey chatted in the back of the lorry, and Hisham produced a white crystalline substance, telling her it was Ice, a street name for meth. He also gave her a glass ball with a rubber tube and told her to smoke it.\nShe did so, and Hisham committed sex acts on her before sending her home.\nTheir relationship later soured and they stopped contacting each other. The offences came to light in February 2020, when the victim attended a session with a case worker and revealed that she had sex with Hisham in 2017.\nA police report was lodged and Hisham was arrested.\nThe court heard that he was previously convicted in 2016 of one count of sexual penetration of a minor and was sentenced to 10 months' jail.\nJustice Mavis Chionh noted that the victim in the latest case was a vulnerable one, and the offences were \"clearly premeditated and deviously planned\".\nShe said Hisham \"trawled the Internet\" and \"zeroed in on the victim and her primary school friends on Instagram\" before initiating contact. He knew \"full well\" that she was a primary school student, said the judge.\nGiving the girl a drug to consume was an aggravating factor as it would have rendered her more vulnerable, said Justice Chionh.\nHisham also exposed her to the grave risk of sexually transmitted diseases. He admitted to a psychiatrist that he frequented sex workers from 2013 to 2018.\nThe judge disagreed with the starting point of 11 years' jail per proceeded charge, saying it should be higher. She noted that the punishment Hisham received in 2016 for his previous crime \"did not teach him anything\".\nA psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health examined Hisham and found that he met the criteria for paedophilic disorder, with a moderate overall risk of sexual reoffending and an \"alarming clear escalation\" in the chronicity of his sexual offences.\nFor sexual assault by penetration of a minor under 16, he could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years' jail, and given at least 12 strokes of the cane.\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nCopyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "content": "Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below.\nBlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line.\n“With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said.\nTotal compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million.\nUBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday.\nThe statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage.\nThe problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022.\nBanking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows.\nThe global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations.\n“The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement.\nUBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse.\nStocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings.\nStill, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%.\nJPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results.\nCEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected.\nWall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June.\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets.\nAustan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month.\nMeanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening.\nConsumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey.\n“There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.\nThe Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%.\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%.\nAs stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly.\nAustan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year.\n“There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\nHe added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth.\n“When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.”\nCritics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions.\nBut sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”.\nIn January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023.\nMalpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering.\n“I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said.\nConsumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday.\nSo far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist.\n“Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning.\n“We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said.\nThe latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.\n“Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall.\nThe latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday.\n“You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\nGoolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit.\nEarlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point.\n“I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.”\nChief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month.\n> Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.”\nStill, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.”\n>“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.”\n> “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday.\n“Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement.\nThat means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens.\n“Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained.\nRegulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected.\n“People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call.\nHigh interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose.\nDimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars.\n“If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said.\n“Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said.\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis.\n“I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market.\nDimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch.\n“I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.”\nJPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability.\n“Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call.\nInvestors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home.\nThe commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy.\n“There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said.\nSpending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis.\nRetail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\nThe drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\nHowever, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%.\nCitigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue.\nThe bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67.\nCiti CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET.\nStocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season.\nInvestors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats.\nShares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%.\nMeanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv.\nThe Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%.\nThe S&P 500 sank 0.1%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%.\nThe Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters.\nThe Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year.\nBostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy.\nAnalysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nRegional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news.\nWells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%.\nJPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\nThe New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv.\nWith $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy.\n“The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release.\nNet interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices.\nDeposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven.\nA key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars.\n“Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.”\nShares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET.\nStocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up.\nFear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed\nOil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon.\nWall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it?\nRecession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health.\nEarnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability.\nStocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then.\n“We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management.\nBut while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.\n“You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman.\nJeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning.\n“Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.”\nSince early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon.\nThe “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added.\nGrantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system.\nWhat’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June.\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets.\nAustan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month.\nMeanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening.\nConsumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey.\n“There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.\nThe Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%.\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%.\nAs stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly.\nAustan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year.\n“There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\nHe added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth.\n“When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.”\nCritics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions.\nBut sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”.\nIn January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023.\nMalpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering.\n“I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said.\nConsumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday.\nSo far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist.\n“Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning.\n“We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said.\nThe latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.\n“Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall.\nThe latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday.\n“You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\nGoolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit.\nEarlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point.\n“I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.”\nChief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month.\n> Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.”\nStill, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.”\n>“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.”\n> “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday.\n“Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement.\nThat means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens.\n“Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained.\nRegulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected.\n“People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call.\nHigh interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose.\nDimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars.\n“If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said.\n“Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said.\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis.\n“I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market.\nDimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch.\n“I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.”\nJPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability.\n“Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call.\nInvestors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home.\nThe commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy.\n“There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said.\nSpending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis.\nRetail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\nThe drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\nHowever, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%.\nCitigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue.\nThe bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67.\nCiti CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET.\nStocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season.\nInvestors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats.\nShares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%.\nMeanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv.\nThe Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%.\nThe S&P 500 sank 0.1%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%.\nThe Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters.\nThe Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year.\nBostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy.\nAnalysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nRegional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news.\nWells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%.\nJPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\nThe New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv.\nWith $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy.\n“The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release.\nNet interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices.\nDeposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven.\nA key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars.\n“Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.”\nShares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET.\nStocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up.\nFear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed\nOil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon.\nWall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it?\nRecession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health.\nEarnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability.\nStocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then.\n“We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management.\nBut while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.\n“You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman.\nJeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning.\n“Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.”\nSince early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon.\nThe “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added.\nGrantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system.\nWhat’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "content": "Microsoft hasn't secretly raised Surface prices, as earlier reports claimed. Instead, it has removed the base models of the Surface Pro 13-inch and Surface Laptop 13.8-inch from Microsoft.com, according to a statement by Nancie Gaskill, GM of the Surface group. \"Customers can purchase base models of Pro and Laptop at the starting price of $999 at other key retailers,\" she added.\nCurrently, you can still find those models at Amazon and Best Buy, where they're discounted to $800. That's the same price as the smaller (and slower) Surface Pro 12-inch, so potential buyers have to think hard about balancing portability versus power. It's also unclear if those base models are still being produced by Microsoft, the company could be trying to sell through it's existing stock so future customers can only order the more expensive models.\nEarlier this week, XDA first noticed a potential Surface price change at Microsoft.com. The starting prices of the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop and 13-inch Surface Pro appeared to jump from $1,000 to $1,200 — but it turns out those are just higher-specced models.\nAnd despite the confusion around actual Surface pricing, Microsoft has definitely made its accessories more expensive. The 65W Surface power supply shot up from $90 to $120 this week, and the 127W variant went from $125 to $175. (Perhaps consider the many cheaper options from Anker and other companies in our fast charging guide.)\nMicrosoft also increased Xbox prices last week increases. The Xbox Series X is now $80 more expensive, while an Xbox Series X costs an extra $100.\nUpdated 5/8/2025 6:00PM: Added Microsoft's statement about not increasing Surface pricing.\nSubscribe to our newsletter:\n- A twice-weekly dose of the news you need\nPlease enter a valid email address\nPlease select a newsletter\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms and Privacy Policy.",

The starting prices of the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop and 13-inch Surface Pro appeared to jump from $1,000 to $1,200 — but it turns out those are just higher-specced models.\nAnd despite the confusion around actual Surface pricing, Microsoft has definitely made its accessories more expensive. The 65W Surface power supply shot up from $90 to $120 this week, and the 127W variant went from $125 to $175. (Perhaps consider the many cheaper options from Anker and other companies in our fast charging guide.)\nMicrosoft also increased Xbox prices last week increases. The Xbox Series X is now $80 more expensive, while an Xbox Series X costs an extra $100.\nUpdated 5/8/2025 6:00PM: Added Microsoft's statement about not increasing Surface pricing.\nSubscribe to our newsletter:\n- A twice-weekly dose of the news you need\nPlease enter a valid email address\nPlease select a newsletter\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms and Privacy Policy.",

    "content": "Investigative Journalism in the Public Interest\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\nLast month, Microsoft announced that Chinese state-sponsored hackers had exploited vulnerabilities in SharePoint, the company’s widely used collaboration software, to access the computer systems of hundreds of companies and government agencies, including the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe company did not include in its announcement, however, that support for SharePoint is handled by a China-based engineering team that has been responsible for maintaining the software for years.\nProPublica viewed screenshots of Microsoft’s internal work-tracking system that showed China-based employees recently fixing bugs for SharePoint “OnPrem,” the version of the software involved in last month’s attacks. The term, short for “on premises,” refers to software installed and run on customers’ own computers and servers.\nMicrosoft said the China-based team “is supervised by a US-based engineer and subject to all security requirements and manager code review. Work is already underway to shift this work to another location.”\nIt’s unclear if Microsoft’s China-based staff had any role in the SharePoint hack. But experts have said allowing China-based personnel to perform technical support and maintenance on U.S. government systems can pose major security risks. Laws in China grant the country’s officials broad authority to collect data, and experts say it is difficult for any Chinese citizen or company to meaningfully resist a direct request from security forces or law enforcement. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has deemed China the “most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, private-sector, and critical infrastructure networks.”\nProPublica revealed in a story published last month that Microsoft has for a decade relied on foreign workers — including those based in China — to maintain the Defense Department’s cloud systems, with oversight coming from U.S.-based personnel known as digital escorts. But those escorts often don’t have the advanced technical expertise to police foreign counterparts with far more advanced skills, leaving highly sensitive information vulnerable, the investigation showed.\nProPublica found that Microsoft developed the escort arrangement to satisfy Defense Department officials who were concerned about the company’s foreign employees, and to meet the department’s requirement that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Microsoft went on to win federal cloud computing business and has said in earnings reports that it receives “substantial revenue from government contracts.” ProPublica also found that Microsoft uses its China-based engineers to maintain the cloud systems of other federal departments, including parts of Justice, Treasury and Commerce.\nIn response to the reporting, Microsoft said that it had halted its use of China-based engineers to support Defense Department cloud computing systems, and that it was considering the same change for other government cloud customers. Additionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth launched a review of tech companies’ reliance on foreign-based engineers to support the department. Sens. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, have written letters to Hegseth, citing ProPublica’s investigation, to demand more information about Microsoft’s China-based support.\nMicrosoft said its analysis showed that Chinese hackers were exploiting SharePoint weaknesses as early as July 7. The company released a patch on July 8, but hackers were able to bypass it. Microsoft subsequently issued a new patch with “more robust protections.”\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said that the vulnerabilities enable hackers “to fully access SharePoint content, including file systems and internal configurations, and execute code over the network.” Hackers have also leveraged their access to spread ransomware, which encrypts victims’ files and demands a payment for their release, CISA said.\nRead More\nA DHS spokesperson said there is no evidence that data was taken from the agency. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy, which includes the National Nuclear Security Administration, said in a statement the agency was “minimally impacted.”\n“At this time, we know of no sensitive or classified information that was compromised,” the spokesperson, Ben Dietderich said.\nMicrosoft has said that, beginning next July, it will no longer support on-premises versions of SharePoint. It has urged customers to switch to the online version of the product, which generates more revenue because it involves an ongoing software subscription as well as usage of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform. The strength of the Azure cloud computing business has propelled Microsoft’s share price in recent years. On Thursday, it became the second company in history to be valued at more than $4 trillion.\nDoris Burke contributed research.\nFiled under —\nI am a ProPublica reporter focused on technology, cybersecurity and business.\nI’m interested in the intersection of Big Tech and national security.

Rubin Observatory is set to revolutionize our knowledge of the solar system's \"small bodies\" -- asteroids, comets and other minor planets.\nThe Rubin Observatory, under construction on the Cerro Pachón ridge in northern Chile, features the 8.4-meter Simonyi Survey Telescope with a unique three-mirror design capable of surveying the entire visible sky every few nights. At its heart is the world's largest digital camera -- the 3.2 gigapixel Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Camera -- covering a 9.6 square-degree field of view with six filters, roughly 45 times the area of the full moon. Together, this \"wide-fast-deep\" system will generate 20 terabytes of data every night -- creating an unprecedented time-lapse \"movie\" of the cosmos over the next 10 years, and an incredibly powerful dataset with which to map the solar system.\nThe team of astronomers, led by Queen's University's Meg Schwamb, created Sorcha, an innovative new open-source software used to predict what discoveries are likely to be made. Sorcha is the first end-to-end simulator that ingests Rubin's planned observing schedule. It applies assumptions on how Rubin Observatory sees and detects astronomical sources in its images with the best model of what the solar system and its small body reservoirs look like today.\n\"Accurate simulation software like Sorcha is critical,\" said Schwamb, a reader in the School of Mathematics and Physics at Queen's University. \"It tells us what Rubin will discover and lets us know how to interpret it. Our knowledge of what objects fill Earth's solar system is about to expand exponentially and rapidly.\"\nIn addition to the eight major planets, the solar system is home to a vast population of small bodies that formed alongside the planets more than 4.5 billion years ago. Many of these smaller bodies remain essentially unchanged since the solar system's birth, acting as a fossil record of its earliest days. By studying their orbits, sizes and compositions, astronomers can reconstruct how planets formed, migrated and evolved.\nThese objects -- numbering in the tens of millions -- -- provide a powerful window into processes such as the delivery of water and organic material to Earth, the reshaping of planetary orbits by giant planets and the ongoing risk posed by those whose paths bring them near our planet.\nIn addition to Queen's University and the UW, the international team includes researchers from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nA series of papers describing the software and the predictions have been accepted for publication by The Astronomical Journal.\nBeyond just finding these new small bodies, Rubin Observatory will observe them multiple times using different optical filters, revealing their surface colors. Past solar system surveys typically observed with a single filter.\n\"With the LSST catalog of solar system objects, our work shows that it will be like going from black-and-white television to brilliant color,\" said Joe Murtagh, a doctoral student at Queen's University. \"It's very exciting -- we expect that millions of new solar system objects will be detected and most of these will be picked up in the first few years of sky survey.\"\nThe team's simulations show that Rubin will map:\n127,000 near-Earth objects -- asteroids and comets whose orbits cross or approach Earth. That's more than tripling today's known objects, about 38,000, and detecting more than 70% of potentially hazardous bodies larger than 140 meters. This will cut the risk of undetected asteroid impact of catastrophic proportions by at least two times, making a tremendous contribution to planetary defense.\nOver 5 million main-belt asteroids, up from about 1.4 million, with precise color and rotation data on roughly one in three asteroids within the survey's first years. This will give scientists unprecedented insight into the characteristics and history of the solar system's building blocks.\n109,000 Jupiter Trojans, bodies sharing Jupiter's orbit at stable \"Lagrange\" points -- more than seven times the number cataloged today. These bodies represent some of the most pristine material dating all the way back to the formation of the planets.\n37,000 trans-Neptunian objects, residents of the distant Kuiper Belt -- nearly 10 times the current census -- shedding light on Neptune's past migration and the outer solar system's history.\nApproximately 1,500-2,000 Centaurs, bodies on short-lived giant planet-crossing orbits in the middle solar system. Most Centaurs will eventually be ejected from the solar system, but a few lucky ones will survive to become short-period comets. The LSST will provide the first detailed view of the Centaurs and the important transition stage from Centaur to comet.\nRubin Observatory's LSST is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fill in the missing pieces of our solar system, said Mario Juric, a member of the Sorcha team and a UW professor of Astronomy. Juric also is a team lead of Rubin's Solar System Processing Pipelines and a director of UW's DiRAC Institute.\n\"Our simulations predict that Rubin will expand known small-body populations by factors of 4-9x, delivering an unprecedented trove of orbits, colors and light curves,\" Juric said. \"With this data, we'll be able to update the textbooks of solar system formation and vastly improve our ability to spot -- and potentially deflect -- the asteroids that could threaten Earth.\"\nIt took 225 years of astronomical observations to detect the first 1.5 million asteroids, and researchers found that Rubin will double that number in less than a year, said Jake Kurlander, a doctoral student at the UW.\n\"Rubin's unparalleled combination of breadth and depth make it a uniquely effective discovery machine,\" Kurlander said.\nSiegfried Eggl, an assistant professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign added: \"Only by debiasing LSST's complex observing pattern can we turn raw detections into a true reflection of the solar system's history -- where the planets formed, and how they migrated over billions of years. Sorcha is a game changer in that respect.\"\nThe Sorcha code is open-source and freely available with the simulated catalogs, animations at https://sorcha.space. By making these resources available, the Sorcha team has enabled researchers worldwide to refine their tools and be ready for the flood of LSST data that Rubin will generate, advancing the understanding of the small bodies that illuminate the solar system like never before.\nRubin Observatory is scheduled to unveil its first spectacular imagery at its \"First Look\" event on June 23, offering the world an early glimpse of the survey's power. Full science operations are slated to begin later this year.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by University of Washington. Original written by Jackson Holtz.

Its statement said many dead bodies were found scattered across a wide area of the shore.\nDespite more than a decade of civil war , Yemen is a major route for people from east Africa and the Horn of Africa trying to reach the Gulf Arab countries for work. Migrants are taken by smugglers on often dangerous, overcrowded boats across the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden.\nHundreds of people have died or gone missing in shipwrecks off Yemen in recent months, including in March when two migrants died and 186 others were missing after four boats capsized off Yemen and Djibouti , according to the IOM.\nMore than 60,000 migrants arrived in Yemen in 2024, down from 97,200 in 2023, probably because of greater patrolling of the waters, according to an IOM report in March.",

But HIV attacks the immune system, and the body rarely manages to clear it out. As a result, candidates for vaccines against the virus must undergo lots of testing through trial and error.\nThat makes HIV vaccines a good place to use mRNA technology. The first mRNA vaccine was approved in 2020, for COVID-19. Compared with other modes of delivery, mRNA vaccines can be modified at low cost quickly — in months, not years — which enables researchers to test out different strategies. The vaccines work by delivering instructions to cells, in the form of mRNA, to produce specific proteins typically found on the surface of viruses. This induces an immune response, which helps the body to recognize and clear out a virus, should it be exposed to the real thing.\nHIV uses an ‘envelope’ protein on its outer membrane to bind to and infect cells. In the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, a team including William Schief at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, who works on protein design, conducted a small trial, comparing two vaccine approaches. In one, the standard method for HIV vaccine candidates, the cell is directed to produce envelope proteins that float freely. In the other, the mRNA vaccine instructs the cell to make envelope proteins that are attached to the cell membrane — similar to how they are found in the live virus. The authors describe animal tests of this method in a companion paper2.\nThe trial involved 108 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 across ten study sites in the United States. It tested two membrane-bound vaccine candidates and one unbound candidate.\nParticipants each received three doses of a single vaccine, at a low or high dose, several weeks apart; which vaccine they received was selected randomly. The vaccines were provided by pharmaceutical company Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Schief is vice-president for protein design.\nSome 80% of the participants who received either of the vaccines that made membrane-bound proteins went on to produce antibodies that could block that protein from entering cells. By contrast, only 4% of the participants who received the unbound-protein vaccine produced corresponding antibodies.\n“The difference is pretty striking,” says Lewin. She expects the findings to inform the development of future vaccine candidates.\nor\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-02439-4\nParks, K. R. et al. Sci. Transl.

    "content": "Michelle Wilson, 52, from Southport, Merseyside, says the parasail operator pressed himself against her and groped her mid-air during what should have been a thrilling ride.\nMichelle had planned to go on a tandem parasail flight with a friend, but was told it was too windy in Tunisia that day and they would have to fly separately, each accompanied by an operator.\nShe said her friend went up first “and had a great time, with no problems”, noting there was plenty of distance between her friend and the operator.\nHowever, Michelle’s own experience was very different.\nThe mum-of-three said:\n“I could feel the back of my bikini bottoms being pulled and he was pulling the strap. He must have been tightening the harness to get me closer. His legs straddled around me, he had one hand up on the parachute, the other wasn’t. Then I felt him touch my leg.”\nShe continued: “He was groping me and moving back and forth into me and talking to me in Arabic. I felt him pressing against me. I kept arching my back.\n\"I felt violated and dirty and was scared. He was only a young lad, maybe around 20. It was a horrible experience and I was really scared. I felt helpless hanging in the air.”\nMichelle burst into tears after landing and reported the incident to the water sports centre’s manager before going to the local police.\nThe £6,000 easyJet package holiday had been booked for Michelle, her 17-year-old daughter, her 16-year-old twin boys, and her daughter’s 17-year-old friend.\nHowever, she said she felt unable to enjoy the rest of the trip after what happened.\nShe added: “As women you expect a bit of banter from men in these countries, but this wasn’t banter, it was a sexual assault.”\nMichelle believes her alleged attacker has since been arrested, and that both her insurance firm and the Foreign Office are now involved in the case.\nAn easyJet spokesperson said:\n“The safety and wellbeing of our customers is a priority, and we are continuing to support Ms Wilson.

The group, Veterans on Patrol, is going after government radars because it believes they're being used as \"weather weapons.\"\nCNN learned of the possible attacks through NOAA emails warning NWS staff that Veterans on Patrol was planning to conduct \"penetration drills on NEXRAD sites to identify weaknesses,\" with the ultimate goal of destroying NEXRAD. Despite its cooler-than-average name, the NWS uses NEXRAD or \"Next Generation Weather Radar\" for a fairly mundane purpose: detecting precipitation in the atmosphere. NEXRAD plays a vital role in locating thunderstorms and tornados, making it easier to evacuate vulnerable communities before disaster strikes.\nIt's not clear what Veterans on Patrol sees as threatening about radar — the group was previously focused on white nationalism and Pizzagate-style government conspiracies — but concern over the effects of being exposed to radio waves is a common bugbear for conspiracy-types. For example, groups set fire to cell towers early in the COVID-19 pandemic because of a belief that 5G somehow spread the virus.

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nNonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.\nHealth care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.\nThe health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nScheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.\n“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.\nBut naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.\nUnlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.\nSome local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.\nBut some officials remain unconvinced.\nIn May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.\nThat move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.\n“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.\n“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.\nWhile Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”\nErlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.\n“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.\n“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”\nBranding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.\n“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”\nBut as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.\nAfter the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.\nHospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.\n“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.\n“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”\nBut the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.\nA Valley Children’s spokesperson told Stateline that game-day entitlements at the stadium, such as the tailgates, catering and suite, have been used for patients and their families.\nThe outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.\nIn 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.\nIn Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.\nAnd in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.\nStadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.\n“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”\nFor example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.\nAnd sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.\n“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”\nWith Trump’s fascist agenda driving the narrative, it’s the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.\nYet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining. Why? Blatant political censorship from Big Tech.\nAs we face mounting repression, Truthout appeals for your support.

He said guards stomped on his hands, poured filthy water into his ears and threatened to beat him if he didn’t kneel alongside other inmates and lick their backs.\nNow that he’s free, Juan José Ramos Ramos, 39, insists he’s not who President Donald Trump says he is. He’s not a member of a gang or an international terrorist, just a man with tattoos whom immigration agents spotted riding in a car with a Venezuela sticker on the back.\nNow that he’s free, Andry Omar Blanco Bonilla, 40, said he wondered every day of his time in prison whether he’d ever hold his mother in his arms again. He’s relieved to be back home in Venezuela but struggles to make sense of why he and the other men were put through that ordeal in the first place.\n“We are a group of people who I consider had the bad luck of ending up on this black list,” he said.\nThese are the accounts being shared by some of the more than 230 Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported on March 15 to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador known as CECOT. Throughout the men’s incarceration, the administration used blanket statements and exaggerations that obscured the truth about who they are and why they were targeted. The president has both hailed the men’s removal as a signature achievement of his first 100 days in office and touted it as a demonstration of the lengths his administration was willing to go to carry out his mass deportation campaign. He assured the public that he was fulfilling his promise to rid the country of immigrants who’d committed violent crimes, and that the men sent to El Salvador were “monsters,” “savages” and “the worst of the worst.”\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

This article is co-published with The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan local newsroom that informs and engages with Texans, and Alianza Rebelde Investiga and Cazadores de Fake News.\nFew cases have gotten as much attention as the Venezuelans sent to CECOT. They were deported against the instructions of a federal judge, frog-marched off American planes and forced to kneel before cameras and have their heads shaved. The administration rebuffed requests to confirm the men’s names or provide information about the allegations it had made against them. Meanwhile, the deportees were held without access to lawyers or the ability to speak to their families. Then, 12 days ago, they were returned to Venezuela in a prisoner swap.\nNow that they’re home, they’ve begun to talk. We interviewed nine men for this story. They are bewildered, frightened, angry. Some said their feelings about what happened were still so raw they had trouble finding words to describe them. All of the men said they were abused physically and mentally during their imprisonment. Their relatives say they, too, went through hell wondering whether their loved ones were alive or dead, or if they would ever see them again. All the men said they were relieved to be free, though some said their release was proof the U.S. had no reason to send them to prison to begin with.\nBlanco, for example, has no criminal record in the U.S., according to the government’s own data. His only violation was having entered the country illegally. He’d come because he wasn’t earning enough to help his parents and support his seven children, ages 2 to 19, after his family’s wholesale dairy and deli supply business failed. He arrived in December 2023 and turned himself in to immigration authorities in Eagle Pass, Texas, to request asylum. Then he was released to continue his immigration process.\nAfterward, Blanco moved to Dallas and found work delivering food. In February 2024, he accompanied his cousin to a routine appointment with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. While he was there, he decided to notify the agency that he’d changed his address. On his way out of the building, an immigration agent stopped him and asked about his tattoos. He has several of them, including a blue rose, a father hugging his son behind railroad tracks and a clock showing the time his mother was born.\nHe said the tattoos signified his affection for his family, not evidence of affiliation with a gang. Records show the officials didn’t believe him and detained him. While in custody, a judge ordered his deportation. However, because Washington and Caracas don’t have diplomatic relations, the Venezuelan government was refusing to accept most deportees from the United States at the time. Immigration officials released Blanco back into the U.S. until they could send him home.\nFor the next seven months, Blanco continued on in Dallas and picked up additional work as a mechanic. Then, shortly after Trump was inaugurated, ICE officers asked Blanco to come in for another appointment and detained him. A month later, despite Venezuela agreeing to take back some deportees, Blanco was on one of three planes bound for El Salvador.\n“From the moment I realized I was in El Salvador and that I would be detained, it was anguish,” he said. “I was shaken. It hit me hard. Hard, hard, hard.”\nTo deport the Venezuelans, Trump invoked an obscure law from the 1700s known as the Alien Enemies Act. He declared that the men were all part of a Venezuelan prison gang called Tren de Aragua that was invading the United States. Within days, CBS News published a list of the men’s names, and there were anecdotal reports indicating that not all of the deportees were hardened criminals, much less “savages.” By early April, several news organizations had reported that the majority of the men did not appear to have criminal records.\nAdministration officials dismissed the reports, saying that many of the deportees were known human rights abusers, gang members and criminals outside of the U.S. The fact they hadn’t committed crimes in the United States, they said, didn’t mean they weren’t a threat to public safety.\nTo examine those claims, ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and a team of Venezuelan journalists from Alianza Rebelde Investiga (Rebel Alliance Investigates) and Cazadores de Fake News (Fake News Hunters) launched an exhaustive investigation of the backgrounds of the 238 men on the list of detainees first published by CBS. Last week, we published a first-of-its-kind database that highlights our findings, including the fact the Trump administration knew at least 197 of the men had no criminal convictions in the U.S. Nearly half the men had open immigration cases when they were deported, and at least 166 have tattoos, which experts have told us are not an indicator of gang membership.\nWhen asked for comment for this story, Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, called ProPublica a “liberal rag hellbent on defending violent criminal illegal aliens who never belonged in the United States.” She added, “America is safer with them out of our country.”\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson echoed the White House’s claim. “Once again, the media is falling all over themselves to defend criminal illegal gang members,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We hear far too much about gang members and criminals’ false sob stories and not enough about their victims.”\nThe fact that border encounters have plummeted to record lows after reaching record highs during the Biden presidency suggests that the administration’s efforts are having the effect that Trump intended. After what happened to him, Colmenares said he didn’t think migrating to the U.S. was safe anymore.\nHe’d been a youth soccer coach in Venezuela before setting off for the U.S. He followed the rules and got an appointment to approach the U.S.-Mexico border last October, as had more than 50 of the men. At the appointment, Colmenares said an agent pulled him aside to take pictures of his many tattoos — then detained him. He never set foot in the U.S. as a free man.\n“The country with the Statue of Liberty deprived us of our liberty without any kind of evidence,” he said in an interview two days after he was returned to his family. “Who is going to go to the border now, knowing that they will grab you and put you in a prison where they will kill you?”\nThe men we interviewed said the terror they felt in El Salvador began almost immediately upon arrival.\nSalvadoran police boarded the planes and began forcing the shackled men off — shoving them, throwing them to the ground, hitting them with their batons. Five said they saw flight attendants crying at the sight.\n“This will teach you not to enter our country illegally,” Colmenares said one ICE official told him in Spanish. He wanted to explain that wasn’t true in his case but could tell there was no point. He got off the plane and was loaded onto a bus to prison.\nOnce inside, guards stripped them down to white boxers and sandals. Those who tried to refuse to have their heads shaved were beaten. Blanco said he heard their screams and didn’t dare resist. Humiliated and enraged, he did as he was told: head down, body limp.\nThey were loaded up again on the buses and taken to another part of the compound. Blanco said the shackles were so tight that he couldn’t walk as fast as the guards wanted, so they beat him until he passed out and dragged him the rest of the way. Inside, they dropped him so hard that his head banged on the floor. As he opened his eyes and saw the guards, bright lights and polished concrete floor, he asked: “God, why am I here? Why?”\nThe men said beatings by the guards were random, severe and constant. Guards lashed out at them with their fists and batons. They kicked them while wearing heavy work boots and shot them at close range with rubber pellets. One man we spoke to said he suspects he will have a lasting injury from a hard kick to the groin.\nColmenares recalled seeing one man defecate all over himself after a particularly severe beating. Guards laughed at him and left him there for a day, saying that the Venezuelans weren’t “real men.”\nJust as vicious, the men said, was the psychological abuse. They lost track of the days because they were never allowed outdoors. Blanco said that whenever he asked a guard for the time, they’d mock him: “Why do you want to know what time it is? Have somewhere to be? Is someone waiting for you?”\nOver and over, the men said, the guards called them criminals and terrorists and sons of bitches who deserved to be locked up. They said the guards told them so often that they were nobodies and that no one, not even their families, cared about them that some started to believe it.\nThe men said they waged at least two dayslong hunger strikes, skipping the beans, rice and tortillas they were fed most days, to demand an end to the abuses and an explanation for why they were in prison. “They told us nothing about how the process was going, what was going to happen to us, when we were going to see a judge, when we were going to see an attorney,” Ramos said.\nSeveral of those interviewed said suicide crossed their minds. Ramos said he thought: “I’d rather die or kill myself than to keep living through this experience. Being woken up every day at 4 a.m. to be insulted and beaten. For wanting to shower, for asking for something so basic. ... Hearing your brothers getting beaten, crying for help.”\nRead More\nFour talked about a man who started cutting himself and writing messages on the walls and sheets with his blood: “Stop hitting us.” “We are fathers.” “We are brothers.” “We are innocent people.”\nSome of them became friends. They made playing cards out of juice boxes and soaked tortillas in water and shaped the cornmeal into dice. They talked about their families and wondered if anyone knew where they were. They prayed.\nAbout three and a half months into their detention, the men said they noticed a change in the guards and in the conditions in the facility. They were beaten less frequently and less severely. They were given ibuprofen, antibiotics and toothbrushes. They were told to shave and shower. And a psychologist came in to evaluate them.\nThen, sometime after midnight on July 18, guards began banging their batons on the bars of the men’s cells. “Everyone take a shower,” they yelled.\nThis time, when Blanco asked for the time, a guard gave it to him. It was 1:40 a.m.\nPhotographers and reporters were allowed into the facility. Blanco wondered whether he was about to be a part of a publicity stunt. He told himself he wouldn’t give them what they wanted. No smiles for the camera.\nThen, a top Salvadoran official walked in. “You are leaving.”\nIn a brief phone interview, Félix Ulloa, El Salvador’s vice president, denied any mistreatment and pointed to videos of the men looking unscathed as they left the prison as proof they were in good shape. He declined to comment on what role, if any, the U.S. had played in what happened to the men while they were in El Salvador. However, according to court records, the Salvadoran government previously told the United Nations that while it was physically holding the men, they remained under U.S. jurisdiction.\nThe Trump administration pledged millions of dollars to El Salvador to hold the deportees in CECOT.\nNatalia Molano, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said the U.S. is not responsible for the conditions of the men’s detention in El Salvador. If there are complaints now that the men have returned to Venezuela, she said, “the United States is not involved in the conversation.”\nDuring his months in CECOT, Ramos said he found solace in the Bible, the only book available. He said he felt particularly drawn to the Book of Job, a wealthy man whom God tested with loss and pain. Despite his losses, Ramos said, Job “never denied God.” He said Job “had a lot of faith.”\nThat’s how Ramos, a former telephone technician, saw his time in El Salvador: a divine test that he’d overcome with faith. The seven long months it had taken him to migrate from Venezuela to the United States — which involved walking through the treacherous Darién jungle — seemed easy by comparison.\nAs soon as his family and neighbors got word that he was on his way home to Guatire, just outside Caracas, they cobbled together $20 to help his mother, Lina Ramos, decorate the house and make a meal of chicken and rice with plantains.\nKnowing that his mother had marched and fought for his release, that no one had forgotten him and the other men who’d been detained with him, he said, “was the best gift we could have gotten.”\nBut the effects of what he went through still linger. Now, when he tries to read the Bible, he said, he notices his sight is failing in his left eye. He thinks it was caused by a particular beating, one of many, where guards repeatedly hit him on his ears and head after he tried to bathe outside of the designated time. He said he has no money at the moment to see a doctor. He arrived home with nothing but the clothes he was wearing.\nHe is sure he’ll work something out, though. He has faith.\nDo You Have Information About the CECOT Deportations?

    "content": "ByLiz Ryan\nByLiz Ryan,\nFormer Contributor.\nYou have to get into the right mental state for a job interview. You know when your best job interview is going to happen? When you had a flat tire, or you couldn't get a cab at the airport the night before. When you're physically exhausted and wrung out, you're more present in the interview. You don't care as much. You aren't pent up and nervous and mewly.\nThe thing to remember before your job interview is that you're going to do beautifully.  You're going to meet a new person -- what's the big deal about that? There's nothing to it. If they don't want to hire you, God bless them. You don't need them. You are perfect in yourself. When you get that and believe it, your job interviews will get a lot easier.\nOh for God's sake Liz, did you ever have to pay a mortgage? Did you ever have a car payment past due?\nYes my darling, I understand that fear. I'm telling you that approaching the interview with the attitude \"Oh God, let me get this job!\" can only hurt you.\nYou want the job? Then you have to go in there and make it clear that you'll take the job if it's a fit for you and you'll walk away from it if it isn't.\nIf you radiate the energy \"Please hire me, I beg you!\" only a terribly fearful manager will hire you. The manager who will hire you in that state is someone who wants his or her new employee to be grateful for the job even if comes with emotional abuse threaded through it. That kind of manager can't help you grow your flame -- he or she can only squash it. You have to believe in yourself before anyone else will.\nFor thousands of years our species has valued courage. We talk about it incessantly. Courage is treating every job interview the same way whether the rent money is in the bank or not.\nYou send out energy waves. Do you doubt it? Think of pheromones. There are confidence-mones, too. Dogs smell fear, and people are no different. When you go into a job interview ready to grovel and beg and roll over and play fetch, you're toast. You have no credibility then.\nYour goal on a job interview is not to please anyone. Your job is to bring yourself to the meeting, completely. Only the people who get you, deserve you.\nThe night before your job interview, lay out your clothes down to the pocket square if you're bringing one. I mean your exact shoes, socks, underwear, shirt, tie, dress or whatever you're wearing. If you're wearing pantyhose to the interview, get them out. Try them on. Don't take any chances. You don't need one extra thing to think about on the interview day.\nWATCH: JP Morgan Chase's Mary Callahan Erdoes' Advice To Her Younger Self\nMake a test drive or bus or train ride before the interview. Don't take a chance that the address on the building is obscured by scaffolding or there's a detour on the way. Go to the building and make sure you know where the entrance is.

They're hiring someone because there are important things that can't happen in the business until this person comes on board and gets things moving. That could be you!\nIn the morning, go to work if you've got a lunchtime or after-work interview. Otherwise, meditate and exercise. Listen to music. Clear everything out of your mind. You can do a little of this even at work if you get a quiet moment. Listen to your favorite song on your headphones. Here are 100 of my favorites to choose from.\nGet out your padfolio with a notepad and pen inside it. Write your questions on the notepad. Tuck several of your job search business cards and a few extra copies of your Human-Voiced Resume into the padfolio, and if you're printing driving directions, do that now.\nIf you can possibly exercise in some way before the interview, do it! Better to be exhausted than overly tight. Loosen up. Run up and down the stairs a few times if nothing else. My daughter is a 21-year-old operatic mezzo and I tell her to do ten minutes of brisk exercise before every audition. Jumping jacks are perfect, because you can do those in a small space.

In case you forgot, it's extremely obvious when your conversation partner has mentally departed the room.

The real you in the chair is a thousand times more important.\nManagers forget job candidates all the time.\nROB: So Liz, you sent me this form to evaluate Janice Allen as a possible lab tech.\nLIZ: Yes.

Part B premiums are expected to rise 11.6% in 2026, nearly double the six percent jump in 2025, according to the 2025 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report (page 204). The report projects a $206.50 monthly premium for next year, up $21.50 or 11.6% from 2025 and the largest Part B increase in dollar terms since 2022, when premiums rose by $21.60.\nThe premium for Medicare Part D is different from the Part B premiums in a few ways. Unlike Part B, Part D is sold by private companies as a standalone policy to those enrolled in traditional Medicare. It is also sold to beneficiaries with Medicare Advantage plans that don't include prescription drug coverage.\nThe actual premium that a beneficiary pays varies according to the plan in which the beneficiary enrolls. That's why the average paid premium for Part D has always been lower than the base beneficiary premium listed in the Trustees report. For 2026, the base premium for Part D is projected to be $38.99.\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\nHow might prices rise even more? Well, the 2026 Social Security COLA is projected to rise between 2.6% and 2.7%. In terms of dollars, if implemented now, that would translate into an increase of $54.14 per month or $649.68 per year, when using the average Social Security check amount for June 2025 ($2,005.05) as the base amount.\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) automatically deducts the Part B premium cost from the Social Security benefits of most Medicare recipients. That would effectively reduce the increase to the average Social Security check from $54.14 to $32.66, after subtracting the projected Part B increase ($21.50) from the projected 2026 COLA raise ($54.14). In that scenario, the Part B increase will consume almost 40% of the monthly increase.\nMedicare Part B pays for doctor visits, outpatient care and some home health care. When enrolled, you pay both a deductible and a monthly premium. For 2026, the premium is currently projected to rise 11.6% to $206.50, up $21.50 from $185.00 in 2025.\nThe Part B deductible is projected to be $288.00 in 2026. That would be a $31.00 increase over the 2025 amount of $257.00. On a percentage basis, it's an increase of 11.2%, in line with the estimated increase of the Part B premium.\nUnlike Part B, there isn't a single \"standard\" Part D premium as it varies by plan. However, the average monthly Part D premium has been relatively stable due to a premium stabilization demonstration that was put in place as part of the Inflation Reduction Act(IRA). The continuation of this demonstration for 2026 is a key factor in keeping Part D costs down.\nThe premium stabilization provision of the IRA limits the amount of the higher costs of Part D drug coverage that plan sponsors can pass on to Medicare enrollees through premium increases. The IRA caps the annual base beneficiary premium (BBP) growth at 6% in 2025. The cap is enforced through increased Medicare subsidies paid directly to plan sponsors.\nAnnual deductible: The standard Part D deductible is projected to increase to $615 in 2026, up from $590 in 2025.\nOut-of-pocket spending cap: A positive change coming in 2026 is the annual out-of-pocket spending cap for prescription drugs under Part D, which will rise to $2,100. This is an increase from the $2,000 limit in 2025. Once beneficiaries reach this cap, they will no longer pay out-of-pocket costs for covered prescription drugs for the remainder of the year.\nMedicare open enrollment runs from October 15 to December 7 annually. During this period, you can switch from original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan, or vice versa. You can also choose a new Advantage plan or Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage.\nTo get the most from your plan, it’s important to understand your out-of-pocket costs for premiums, which will vary depending on your plan and income. For instance, you could also owe a monthly surcharge on Medicare Part B and Part D premiums based on an income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA).\nYour IRMAA liability for 2026 will be based on the MAGI shown on your 2024 return. While you can't do anything to change your 2024 tax return, you can look over your finances to see if you are in danger of paying the IRMMA in 2027, which will be based on your yet-to-be-filed 2025 tax return.\nIncome planning can go a long way in limiting your exposure to the surcharge. For instance, a well-timed Roth conversion can reduce your taxable income and eliminate required minimum distributions (RMD).\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has started releasing information for plan year 2026. In the lead-up to the release of the new premium and deductible amounts, the CMS has adopted some new rules and updated existing numbers in preparation for the open enrollment season that begins in October. Check out these six Medicare Changes Coming in 2026 and check back periodically; I will be adding to the list as more information becomes available.\nProjections for Medicare Part B and Part D premiums for 2026 are primarily derived from the annual Medicare Trustees Report. While the final figures are usually announced by CMS in October of the preceding year (so, October 2025 for 2026 premiums), the Trustees Report provides strong estimates.\nProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.

The team of researchers devised a new, easy-to-create, three-dimensional olfactory tissue mouse model or organoid to help scientists better study how neurons are continually formed in the nose and why this process might decline in disease and aging.\nTheir research, published recently in Cell Reports Methods, uses this mouse model to show how two types of stem cells in the nose, called horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs), communicate and support each other to develop new smell-sensing nerve tissue.\n\"Our research suggests that these two stem cells may be interdependent,\" says Brian Lin, senior author on the study and a research assistant professor in the Department of Developmental, Molecular and Chemical Biology. \"One type that we thought was largely dormant -- HBCs -- may actually play a crucial role in supporting the production of new neurons and the repair of damaged tissue.\"\nUsing this model, the team identified a specific subpopulation of HBCs, marked by their production of the protein KRT5, that actively support the generation of new olfactory neurons. The researchers observed that these particular HBCs play a key role in the formation of the organoids, and they found that when these cells were selectively depleted from the organoid cultures, the generation of new neurons was significantly impaired. These results suggest that these stem cells, once thought to be dormant, are essential players in the regenerative process.\n\"We also looked at cells from mice of different ages and grew them in the model,\" Lin says. \"We found a decline in the ability of the older mice cells to generate new neurons.

That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\nInvestors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.\nThat led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\nHowever, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.\nSmaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.\n“March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.\nCredit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.\nEnhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.\nAverage hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.\nStill, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.\n“The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said.\nEmployers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.\nThe job market could cool further in the coming months.

    "title": "RFK Jr  Announces Repeal Of Policy That Rewarded H 20250804 061422",
    "content": "Authored by Jeff Louderback via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\nIn his department’s latest move related to vaccine-related reform, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Aug. 1 announced more repeals of federal policy that rewarded hospitals for reporting staff vaccination rates.\nKennedy said in a press release that the policy was coercive and denied informed consent.\n“Medical decisions should be made based on one thing: the wellbeing of the person—never on a financial bonus or a government mandate,” Kennedy said. “Doctors deserve the freedom to use their training, follow the science, and speak the truth without fear of punishment.”\nCreated under the Biden administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) inpatient payment rule, the policy linked hospital reimbursement to staff vaccination reporting.\n“Doctors and other providers should have the same autonomy to choose what’s right for their own individual health care needs as the patients for whom they care. Today’s announcement helps put that power back in their hands,” CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in the press release.\nThe move represents the most recent policy repeal under CMS. These moves are “part of a broader HHS effort to restore medical autonomy in federally funded programs and root out financial and regulatory pressures that incentivize physicians towards pre-scripted medical decisions rather than individualized, evidence-based care,” according to the press release.\nSince taking office as HHS secretary, Kennedy has implemented multiple changes regarding vaccines.\nThe Food and Drug Administration in late May said it planned to limit access to future COVID vaccines to people 65 and older and individuals with underlying health conditions.\nThe agency also announced it would permit vaccine manufacturers to coordinate in-depth studies to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID vaccines in children and younger, healthy adults.\nIn recent months, HHS has also dismissed all 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel, ended the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for pregnant women and healthy children, and ordered the removal of mercury from influenza vaccines.\nAfter it voted to advise officials to stop recommending influenza shots that have mercury, the remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) said it plans to look at multiple other vaccines.\nMartin Kulldorff, the new chair of ACIP, said on June 26 that one proposal is to notify the CDC that young children should not receive the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) combination immunization.\nThe agency instead would recommend that children under the age of 47 months get two separate vaccines: the measles, mumps, rubella shot, and the varicella, or chickenpox, vaccine.\nKulldorff noted that the change would reflect data that indicate the MMRV combination vaccine causes more febrile seizures. The CDC reported the same information in a background paper dated June 25.\nA vote on the issue could happen as early as the next ACIP meeting, which is expected to be held in August or September.\nDr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement that “re-examining the childhood vaccine schedule and the use of thimerosal are both politically motivated actions that are not based on science.”\n“Raising questions without adequate data casts doubt on vaccination, which can further drive down confidence in vaccines. More than any other medications, vaccines are extensively and constantly reviewed and evaluated,” she added.\nDuring the ACIP meeting, Kulldorff explained that Kennedy had given the committee “a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine for making vaccine recommendations.”\n“Vaccines are not all good or bad. If you think that all vaccines are safe and effective and want them all, or if you think that all vaccines are dangerous and don’t want any of them, then you don’t have much use for us—you already know what you want,” he said.\n“But if you wish to know which vaccines are suitable for you and your children and at what ages, then we will provide you with evidence-based recommendations,” he added.\nACIP members who were removed by Kennedy said the panel has “lost credibility.” The former members wrote in a July 30 New England Journal of Medicine commentary that the process for recommending vaccines is “rapidly eroding.”\nOn Aug. 1, the CDC notified some outside groups that they can no longer participate in panels that review vaccine data and form recommendations for the ACIP.\nThe panels meet behind closed doors and typically include members of the ACIP, which advises the CDC on vaccines. The workgroups are also composed of experts from liaison organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nGroups that employ the experts have been informed that they won’t be part of the workgroups any longer, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CDC’s parent agency, told The Epoch Times on Aug. 1.\nAn official said some groups are being removed from the workgroups because of concerns that they have conflicts of interest.\nFor instance, the American Pharmacists Association lists vaccine manufacturers such as GlaxoSmithKline and Moderna among its corporate supporters.\n“Under the old ACIP, outside pressure to align with vaccine orthodoxy limited asking the hard questions. The old ACIP members were plagued by conflicts of interest, influence, and bias. We are fulfilling our promise to the American people to never again allow those conflicts to taint vaccine recommendations,” Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the HHS, told The Epoch Times in an email.\nLast month, six medical organizations—including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM)—and a pregnant woman filed a lawsuit against HHS and Kennedy in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that they intentionally removed vaccines and unjustly removed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s entire vaccine advisory panel.\nThe legal action seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions to stop Kennedy’s new COVID vaccine recommendations and a declaratory judgment declaring the decision unlawful.\nJack Phillips and Zachary Stieber contributed to this report.\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\nAdvertising: Contact Us\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure.Here's our Cookie Policy.\nHow to report offensive comments\nNotice on Racial Discrimination.",

    "content": "NPR: Every community will be hurt by Corporation for Public Broadcasting closing.\nDespite the protests of millions of Americans, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced it will be winding down its operations after the White House deemed NPR and PBS a \"grift\" and pushed for a Senate vote that eliminated its entire budget.\nThe vote rescinded $1.1 billion that Congress had allocated to CPB to fund public broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. In a press release, CPB explained that the cuts \"excluded funding for CPB for the first time in more than five decades.\" CPB president and CEO Patricia Harrison said the corporation had no choice but to prepare to shut down.\n\"Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,\" Harrison said.\nConcerned Americans also rushed to donate to NPR and PBS stations to confront the funding cuts, The New York Times reported. But those donations, estimated at around $20 million, ultimately amounted to too little, too late to cover the funding that CPB lost.\nAs CPB takes steps to close, it expects that \"the majority of staff positions will conclude with the close of the fiscal year on September 30, 2025.\" After that, a \"small transition team\" will \"ensure a responsible and orderly closeout of operations\" by January 2026. That team \"will focus on compliance, final distributions, and resolution of long-term financial obligations, including ensuring continuity for music rights and royalties that remain essential to the public media system.\"\n\"CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care,\" Harrison said.\nIn a statement, NPR's president and CEO, Katherine Maher, mourned the loss of CPB, warning that it was a \"vital source of funding for local stations, a champion of educational and cultural programming, and a bulwark for independent journalism.\"\nThe agency's shuttering won't just impact public media during Trump's term, Maher suggested, but will cause \"ripple effects\" across \"every public media organization and, more importantly, in every community across the country that relies on public broadcasting.\"\n\"We're grateful to CPB staff for their many years of service to public media,\" Maher said.\nTrump's attacks on CPB also included suing CPB directors who refused to be fired and are part of a broader campaign to eliminate what he views as anti-conservative bias in media. Most recently, Trump's Federal Communications Commission appointed a bias monitor to babysit CBS's programming. Critics fear that could make it easier for Trump to censor CBS News and \"silence dissidence.\" These fights to control the news come at a time when access to local news is shrinking and having an \"insidious effect on\" democracy, the American Journalism Project has warned.\nVowing to help support local stations to fill the gap and keep the public informed, Maher noted that the closure of CPB also \"represents the loss of a major institution and decades of knowledge and expertise\" that has guided how the US fosters media as a public service for 60 years.\n\"As an independent, nonprofit news organization, NPR remains resolute in our pursuit of our mission: to create an informed and inspired public in partnership with our Member stations,\" Maher said. \"We will continue to respond to this crisis by stepping up to support locally owned, nonprofit public radio stations and local journalism across the country, working to maintain public media's promise of universal service, and upholding the highest standards for independent journalism and cultural programming in service of our nation.\"\nHarrison thanked partners for helping to keep CPB's mission alive.\n\"Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said. “We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.\"\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

That alert was later downgraded to orange, indicating that aircraft should continue to travel through the area with caution. \"Ash explosions up to 10 km (32,800 ft) a.s.l. could occur at any time,\" read a statement from Russia's Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team.\nКадры первого в истории наблюдения извержения вулкана Крашенинникова на Камчатке:https://t.co/9AL7FpcX2nВидео: Камчатский филиал ФИЦ ЕГС РАН pic.twitter.com/6TJPVGRTYE\nAccording to the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, the eruption of the volcano is the first in at least 400 years. Nevertheless, it \"is not something out of the ordinary for a region with high volcanic activity,\" Vsevolod Yakovlev , the acting director of the reserve said in a statement on Sunday. He added the reserve employees have evacuated the area around the volcano. The region is sparsely populated and there is currently no threat to people in the area, the statement also said.\nThe volcano is located just 143 miles (230 km) north of the epicenter of a massive earthquake that took place off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on July 30. The magnitude 8.8 quake was among the top ten of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. \nThe quake triggered tsunami warnings across much of the Pacific, including Japan, Hawaii and the coast of California. But despite its power, it did relatively little damage. Researchers are studying why it triggered only a modest tsunami compared to other large quakes in the region, like the magnitude 9.1 Tohoku earthquake off the coast of Japan that triggered a large Tsunami in 2011, killing thousands.\nThe latest volcanic activity on Kamchatka could be related to the quake, according to Harold Tobin, a professor of seismology and geohazards at the University of Washington and director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.\n\"It is definitely an interesting coincidence… Or not coincidence,\" Tobin told NPR.\nTobin doubts the quake alone would have triggered the eruption. But he said if the Krasheninnikov Volcano was near erupting on its own, the quake's seismic waves could \"shake loose the system that then allows it to actually erupt.\"\n\"It wouldn't have experienced really extreme shaking,\" Tobin said. \"Nonetheless, seismic waves that are passing through the earth are certainly affecting underground systems like potentially magma that's in cracks in the rock inside a volcano.\"\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor",

    "content": "HIVE Digital co-founder Frank Holmes tied recent hash rate fluctuations to sanctioned nations mining Bitcoin as a workaround to sanctions.\nCover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\nHIVE Digital co-founder Frank Holmes stated this week that several sanctioned nations are actively mining Bitcoin (BTC) in secret, turning to the crypto as an alternative revenue stream in the face of U.S. financial restrictions.\nHolmes made the claims during a recent interview with the Roundtable. He tied a recent drop in global mining difficulty to military strikes targeting power infrastructure in Iran, suggesting the country’s military was using energy resources to mine Bitcoin and generate hard currency.\nThe comments reflect a broader trend in which governments cut off from traditional financial systems are leveraging crypto mining to fill economic gaps.\nHolmes said this is not limited to Iran, implying that other countries facing US sanctions are also participating in similar operations, though much of it remains undisclosed.\nHe further claimed that Bitcoin has become a strategic asset, especially for nations struggling to access dollars. Mining provides a direct route to accumulate value outside the traditional financial ecosystem.\nHolmes said that disruptions to mining facilities can now be observed in network-level data such as hash rate fluctuations.\nWhile pointing to adversaries of the US using crypto mining as a financial lifeline, HIVE Digital is pursuing growth in U.S.-aligned nations.\nThe company recently expanded its footprint in Paraguay, acquiring infrastructure to scale operations more rapidly. The decision required divesting a portion of its Bitcoin holdings, but Holmes described it as a strategic trade-off to accelerate production.\nParaguay’s supportive regulatory stance and energy resources make it a key location for HIVE’s expansion, particularly compared to more politically volatile countries in the region.\nThe move comes amid growing sentiment that Bitcoin mining will continue to flourish in jurisdictions aligned with U.S. economic interests, particularly under the current administration.\nHIVE has now surpassed 14 exahashes per second (EH/s) in mining capacity, with a goal of reaching 25 EH/s by the end of November. At current output, the company is generating approximately $315 million in annualized revenue, placing it among the top contenders in terms of efficiency and scale.\nThe remarks highlight a shifting landscape where mining activity is not just about profitability, but increasingly intertwined with global alliances, sanctions evasion, and power projection through digital infrastructure.\nAJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will expand its series of crypto roundtables and take its crypto policy outreach on the road beginning Aug. 4 in Berkeley, California.\nAccording to an Aug. 1 statement, the tour is meant to give founders and developers, especially teams with 10 or fewer employees and less than two years old, face time with the Commission outside Washington, D.C.\nCrypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce stated the agency wants to hear from stakeholders who could not attend prior sessions, adding:\n“The Crypto Task Force is acutely aware that any regulatory framework will have far-reaching effects, and we want to ensure that our outreach is as comprehensive as possible.”\nTeams can request a slot by emailing [email protected] with the subject line “Crypto on the Road,” naming the city of interest and including one or two attendee names along with a brief description of the project and team.\nTo promote transparency, the Task Force plans to publish a list of participating projects.\nThe new “Crypto on the Road” schedule runs through December. The Task Force plans to visit Berkeley on Aug. 4, Boston on Aug. 19, Dallas on Sept. 4, Chicago on Sept. 15, New York City on Sept. 25, Irvine on Oct. 3, Cleveland on Oct. 24, Scottsdale on Oct. 29, New York City again on Nov. 12, and Ann Arbor on Dec. 5.\nDates are tentative and may shift as logistics are finalized.\nThe roadshow builds on the SEC’s spring engagement with industry players. The Commission held its first Crypto Task Force roundtable on March 21 in Washington.\nPanelists ranging from advocates to skeptics concurred that there is a pressing need for regulatory clarity for digital assets, despite the diverging opinions on how to establish it.\nMuch of the debate centered on token classification and whether existing securities laws adequately address decentralized systems.\nAdvocates pointed to decentralization as a key gauge for determining when a token should fall outside securities laws. At the same time, skeptics argued the Howey test remains workable, noting the SEC’s track record in recent motions.\nFollowing the first roundtable, the SEC decided to host four additional events, ranging from regulation clarity to decentralized finance’s role in US innovation.\nBy moving conversations into local hubs, the Commission is seeking a wider sample of real-world experience, from smart contract developers and tokenization teams to early-stage consumer apps, before it advances proposals that could define how crypto fits under federal securities law.\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

    "title": "See the Bizarre Life Forms Scientists Found More T 20250804 060604",
    "content": "At approximately 31,000 feet, researchers found centipede-like critters—actually a type of worm called macellicephaloides—amid smaller tube worms.Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering, CAS\nThis story was originally published by Vox.com and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nThe Titanic lies about 12,500 feet under the ocean surface. The pressure down there is so immense that even submersibles supposedly built for those conditions can, as we know, tragically fail.\nNow imagine taking a sub nearly three times deeper.\nThat’s what an international team of scientists did last summer. Led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the researchers took a manned submersible to the bottom of deep-sea trenches in an area in the northwest Pacific Ocean, roughly between Japan and Alaska, reaching a depth of more than 31,000 feet.\nThe researchers weren’t looking for a shipwreck. They were interested in what else might be lurking on the seafloor, which is so deep that no light can reach it.\nIt was there that they found something remarkable: entire communities of animals, rooted in organisms that are able to derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions. Through a process called chemosynthesis, deep-sea microbes are able to turn compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide into organic compounds, including sugars, forming the base of the food chain. The discovery was published in the journal Nature.\nThis was the deepest community of chemosynthetic life ever discovered, according to Mengran Du, a study author and researcher at the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nUsing a deep-sea vessel called Fendouzhe, the researchers encountered abundant wildlife communities, including fields of marine tube worms peppered with white marine snails. The worms have a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live in their bodies.

    "content": "At approximately 31,000 feet, researchers found centipede-like critters—actually a type of worm called macellicephaloides—amid smaller tube worms.Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering, CAS\nThis story was originally published by Vox.com and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nThe Titanic lies about 12,500 feet under the ocean surface. The pressure down there is so immense that even submersibles supposedly built for those conditions can, as we know, tragically fail.\nNow imagine taking a sub nearly three times deeper.\nThat’s what an international team of scientists did last summer. Led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the researchers took a manned submersible to the bottom of deep-sea trenches in an area in the northwest Pacific Ocean, roughly between Japan and Alaska, reaching a depth of more than 31,000 feet.\nThe researchers weren’t looking for a shipwreck. They were interested in what else might be lurking on the seafloor, which is so deep that no light can reach it.\nIt was there that they found something remarkable: entire communities of animals, rooted in organisms that are able to derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions. Through a process called chemosynthesis, deep-sea microbes are able to turn compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide into organic compounds, including sugars, forming the base of the food chain. The discovery was published in the journal Nature.\nThis was the deepest community of chemosynthetic life ever discovered, according to Mengran Du, a study author and researcher at the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nUsing a deep-sea vessel called Fendouzhe, the researchers encountered abundant wildlife communities, including fields of marine tube worms peppered with white marine snails. The worms have a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live in their bodies. Those bacteria provide them with a source of nutrients in exchange for, among other things, a stable place to live.\nAmong the tube worms the scientists encountered white, centipede-like critters—they’re also a kind of worm, in the genus macellicephaloides—as well as sea cucumbers.\nThe researchers also found a variety of different clams on the seafloor, often alongside anemones.

    "content": "Reporter\nFlags at the U.S. Agency for International Development headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 3, 2025.\nReporter\nPresident John F. Kennedy said in 1961 that “there is no escaping” what he described as America’s “moral obligations as a wise leader and good neighbor in the interdependent community of free nations; our economic obligations as the wealthiest people in a world of largely poor people, as a nation no longer dependent upon the loans from abroad that once helped us develop our own economy; and our political obligations as the single largest counter to the adversaries of freedom.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nHe was speaking to Congress about foreign aid and later that year would establish through executive order what has since been known as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which helped make the U.S. the world’s largest foreign aid provider.\nFor more than six decades, USAID has helped dozens of low- and middle-income countries, including conflict-stricken ones, to improve access to food, water, health care, and education. It’s helped stop disease outbreaks, revolutionize agricultural practices, and in some cases, promote democracy.\nBut on Tuesday, USAID shutters its doors for good.\nThe agency’s dismantling began just days after President Donald Trump returned to the White House at the start of this year. Tech billionaire and one-time Trump ally Elon Musk, who was spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, singled out the agency as a locus of “corruption and waste,” despite the fact that it constituted just about 0.5% of government spending.\nAdvertisement\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who took the reins of the agency in February, said in March that more than four-fifths of USAID programs were cancelled, and the approximately 1,000 that remained would be absorbed by the State Department by July 1, even amid court battles about the constitutionality of USAID’s closure.\nOn the eve of USAID’s final day, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama gathered with former staffers as well as U2 singer and humanitarian Bono on a video call. Obama described USAID’s gutting as a “travesty” and a “tragedy,” according to the Associated Press.\n“You’ve showed the great strength of America through your work,” Bush told the USAID staffers. “Is it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you.”\nTrump, evidently, does not.\nJust how many lives won’t be saved as a result of the closure of USAID has been the subject of several studies and projections.\nAdvertisement\nOn Monday, medical research journal The Lancet estimated that USAID prevented the deaths of more than 90 million people between 2001 to 2021. The study, conducted by researchers from Brazil, Mozambique, and Spain, forecasted that the defunding of the agency could lead to some 14 million deaths by 2030, including 4.5 million deaths of children and babies under the age of 5.\nHere are some of the biggest estimated impacts of the U.S. shirking Kennedy’s “obligations.”\nTo fight against HIV globally, President Bush launched PEPFAR, or the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, in 2003. The program supports some 20.6 million people with HIV worldwide, including 566,000 children, through providing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to control the infection. The program also provided HIV testing services to 83.8 million people in 2024.\nUSAID was PEPFAR’s main implementing agency, and while the State Department is seeking $2.9 billion in funding to continue HIV-AIDS programs, it’s far lower than the at least $4.7 billion budget PEPFAR had.\nAdvertisement\nA study published in the Retrovirology journal in March said that the suspension of USAID funding could hamper access to ART and cause a potential resurgence of up to 630,000 HIV-AIDS-related deaths annually, with sub-Saharan Africa most affected.\nUSAID has invested $9 billion to help tackle malaria, the mosquito-borne illness that is preventable and curable but causes millions of deaths in Africa every year, since the inception of the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005.\nAn impact tracker by Boston University infectious disease mathematical modeller and health economist Dr. Brooke Nichols and Amsterdam-based product manager Eric Moakley forecast almost 10 million additional cases of malaria globally—of which an estimated 7 million would affect children—in just one year due to USAID funding cuts.\nThe tracker also only considered African countries that were part of PMI and did not include countries in Asia that have also been supported by USAID. “Thus we may be underestimating the effect of PMI’s cessation,” it said.\nAdvertisement\nThe war-torn northeast African country of Sudan was among those worst hit by USAID’s suspension. More than half of its 50 million population is in need of humanitarian assistance as residents suffer from famine and disease outbreaks amid ongoing conflict. The World Health Organization estimates that 5 million Sudanese people may lose access to “lifesaving” health services as a result of the cuts, according to the Washington Post.\nNaomi Ruth Pendle, a lecturer at the University of Bath in the U.K., wrote for The Conversation in April that the sudden suspension of USAID is “is set to make the famine in Sudan the deadliest for half a century.”\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

    "title": "Shuttering of USAID Will Lead to Millions of Death 20250804 061641",
    "content": "Reporter\nFlags at the U.S. Agency for International Development headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 3, 2025.\nReporter\nPresident John F. Kennedy said in 1961 that “there is no escaping” what he described as America’s “moral obligations as a wise leader and good neighbor in the interdependent community of free nations; our economic obligations as the wealthiest people in a world of largely poor people, as a nation no longer dependent upon the loans from abroad that once helped us develop our own economy; and our political obligations as the single largest counter to the adversaries of freedom.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nHe was speaking to Congress about foreign aid and later that year would establish through executive order what has since been known as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which helped make the U.S. the world’s largest foreign aid provider.\nFor more than six decades, USAID has helped dozens of low- and middle-income countries, including conflict-stricken ones, to improve access to food, water, health care, and education. It’s helped stop disease outbreaks, revolutionize agricultural practices, and in some cases, promote democracy.\nBut on Tuesday, USAID shutters its doors for good.\nThe agency’s dismantling began just days after President Donald Trump returned to the White House at the start of this year. Tech billionaire and one-time Trump ally Elon Musk, who was spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, singled out the agency as a locus of “corruption and waste,” despite the fact that it constituted just about 0.5% of government spending.\nAdvertisement\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who took the reins of the agency in February, said in March that more than four-fifths of USAID programs were cancelled, and the approximately 1,000 that remained would be absorbed by the State Department by July 1, even amid court battles about the constitutionality of USAID’s closure.\nOn the eve of USAID’s final day, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama gathered with former staffers as well as U2 singer and humanitarian Bono on a video call. Obama described USAID’s gutting as a “travesty” and a “tragedy,” according to the Associated Press.\n“You’ve showed the great strength of America through your work,” Bush told the USAID staffers. “Is it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you.”\nTrump, evidently, does not.\nJust how many lives won’t be saved as a result of the closure of USAID has been the subject of several studies and projections.\nAdvertisement\nOn Monday, medical research journal The Lancet estimated that USAID prevented the deaths of more than 90 million people between 2001 to 2021. The study, conducted by researchers from Brazil, Mozambique, and Spain, forecasted that the defunding of the agency could lead to some 14 million deaths by 2030, including 4.5 million deaths of children and babies under the age of 5.\nHere are some of the biggest estimated impacts of the U.S. shirking Kennedy’s “obligations.”\nTo fight against HIV globally, President Bush launched PEPFAR, or the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, in 2003.

Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, more commonly referred to as SIHH, has arrived! Amongst the exhibitors at this grandiose affair are Cartier, Piaget, Vacheron Constantin, A. Lange & Sohne, and a plethora of other Richemont brands and independent watchmaking houses. When it comes to ultra-luxury watches, I tend to prefer the simpler designs, such as the new Saxonia Automatik by A. Lange & Sohne.\nJust the thought of a 38.5 millimeter dress watch, for quite some time, I considered gauche. But since seeing Lange's reinvented Saxonia Automatik, not only has my outlook on relatively large timepieces changed, but I'd be down to wear this watch any day.\nIts brilliant pink gold case is home to the splendid manufacture calibre L086.1 self-winding movement. As Lange's 50th in-house caliber, this movement marks a milestone in the company's great history as Germany's foremost watch manufacture. I must add, never have I witnessed a finer finishing on any other automatic movement, and Lange's creative use of German Silver is definitely something to laud. As expected, a power reserve of 72 hours and many components--209, to be exact.\nWhat I admire most about this piece is the elegant, simplistic solid silver dial. Oversized would be an understatement, but surely the dial is nothing flashy.  If there was a perfectly-balanced dress watch, one that you can wear (almost) anywhere, the A.

    "title": "Some on air claims about Dominion Voting Systems w 20250804 060353",
    "content": "Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest US media news here or read about today’s settlement in the updates below.\nIn a statement made Tuesday after Fox News settled the defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems, Fox said:\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.”\nSo, what did those rulings say?\nThis is about the topic of falsity. To win a defamation case, you need to prove a few things. Most importantly, you need to prove the statements were false and that they were made with actual malice, otherwise known as a reckless disregard for the truth.\nIn a major pretrial ruling on March 31, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled Dominion had successfully proven that all 20 statements mentioned in its lawsuit against Fox were false.\n“Through its extensive proof, Dominion has met its burden of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact as to falsity… The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” Davis wrote.\nDominion Voting Systems’ co-lead counsel Justin Nelson said he and Dominion’s other attorneys were expecting to go to trial against Fox News on Tuesday.\nThe final deal to settle the case with the right-wing network for $787.5 million came late in the day, and the settlement papers with Fox were signed just “minutes” before the agreement was announced, he said.\nPrior to the last-minute settlement, Nelson told CNN he and other attorneys had been preparing opening statements – even during the two-and-a-half-hour courtroom delay after the lunch recess.\nFox News will pay more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems after lawyers from both sides hammered out a last-minute settlement of the defamation case launched against the right-wing network.\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\nCNN’s Bill Hennessy, court sketch artist, captured scenes from inside the courtroom:\nDominion Voting Systems had two goals in its defamation case against Fox News — accountability and “trying to make Dominion whole,” said Justin Nelson, the lead counsel election technology company.\nBoth were accomplished in this settlement, he told CNN on Tuesday.\nThe payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network’s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client’s company.\n“This is really the first time that anyone has paid a price for telling the lies of the 2020 election and we’re very proud about that,” he said.\nWhile the settlement does not stipulate that Fox’s anchors must acknowledge the lies on air, Nelson said it was a consequential outcome for the network.\nThe texts and emails that emerged during the litigation process from inside the Fox network were valuable, he said. “And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you’re telling lies.”\nPrevious court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air.\n“It’s a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually there’s going to be consequences to that,” Nelson said.\nHe said the settlement with Fox sends a “strong message” to other right-wing outlets in which Dominion has ongoing legal disputes.\nFox News’ payment of $787.5 million to Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\nNotably, in 2017, ABC News paid $177 million after its years-long legal dispute with South Dakota-based meat processor Beef Products Inc. over its textured meat product that the network referred to as “pink slime.”\nAt the time, the settlement was believed to be the biggest amount ever paid in a media defamation case in the United States.\nFox News anchors will not have to acknowledge on-air that it told election lies about Dominion Voting Systems as part of the terms of its settlement, a representative for the election technology company told CNN.\nFox News did acknowledge in its statement that falsehoods were broadcast.\nBut top anchors at the right-wing talk channel will not be required as part of the settlement to acknowledge on air the lies broadcast in the wake of the 2020 election.\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion,”  said the company CEO John Poulos on Tuesday, following the last-minute $787.5 million settlement with the right-wing network.\n“Fox and Dominion have reached a historic settlement. Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my Company, our employees, and our customers. Nothing can ever make up for that,” Poulos said in the statement. “Throughout this process, we have sought accountability and believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading and endorsing lies.”\nSmartmatic, the voting technology company that is suing Fox News for $2.7 billion for defamation said its pending case will further expose wrongdoing by the right-wing network, following the last-minute settlement in the case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.\n“Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy,” said a statement from Smartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly.\nThe settlement for more than $787 million with Fox News represents “a ringing endorsement for truth and accountability,” the attorney representing Dominion Voting Systems said Tuesday.\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” said Justin Nelson of the Susman Godfrey law firm at a news conference outside the courthouse.\nNelson said that more than two years ago a “torrent of lies” had swept Dominion and election officials across America, causing “grievous harm to Dominion and the country.”\nNelson also said the country must “remain ever vigilant to find common ground.”\n“For our democracy to endure for another 250 years and, hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts,” Nelson added.\nThe $787.5 million settlement in the Fox-Dominion case is an unequivocal rebuke of the right-wing news network and its journalism, said Elie Honig, former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n“Translated it means we got caught lying by the judge – and I think that’s exactly why we are seeing this absolutely jaw-dropping number,” Honig told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\nAlthough the amount is about half of what Dominion was asking for, it’s still an astonishing sum, he said.\n“I didn’t think there was any way they would get $1.6 billion – even when they proved their case, even if they proved it overwhelmingly to a jury. Let’s remember, by its own estimation, Dominion valued the entire company at somewhere between $30 and $80 million. This settlement is 10 times the value of Dominion as an entire company. That’s how strong a statement this is with this number,” Honig explained.\nDominion Voting Systems still has pending lawsuits against right-wing networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell.\nAll of these parties and entities deny wrongdoing and are fighting the lawsuits.\nFollowing the announcement of a $787.5 million dollar settlement in the Fox News-Dominion case, John Poulos, the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems, said Fox News “admitted to telling lies” about the company.\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Poulos said.\n“Nothing can ever make up for that,” Poulos added at a news conference following court.\n“I cannot thank the election officials that we serve enough. Without them, there is no democracy,” he said.\nFox News has issued a statement on its settlement with Dominion Voting Systems acknowledging that some of the right-wing network’s on-air statements about Dominion were false.\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said.\nFor context: The statement was referring to Judge Eric Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\nThe settlement between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems totals $787,500,000, according to Dominion attorney Justin Nelson.\nThe settlement represents “vindication and accountability,” Nelson said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon.\n“The truth matters, lies have consequences,” Nelson said\n“Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm,” Nelson added.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis praised both sides after they abruptly settled the defamation case between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems at the last second.\nHe said, “I have been on the bench since 2010… I think this is the best lawyering I’ve had, ever.”\n“I would be proud to be your judge in the future,” Davis said, his final words before leaving the bench.\nThe hearing is now over. The case is now over.\nA last-second settlement has been reached in Dominion Voting Systems’ historic defamation lawsuit against Fox News, the parties announced Tuesday in court.\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said.  “Your presence here… was extremely important. And without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation,” the judge told the jurors, before dismissing them.\nThe settlement was apparently brokered while the trial was on the brink of opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware.\nAfter swearing in the jury earlier Tuesday, an unexplained hours-long delay paused proceedings in court, which yet again triggered rampant speculation that a deal was quietly in the works.\nWhat this means: The last-minute deal means the closely watched case is effectively over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\nDetails of the settlement were not immediately available and might never become public.\nMore on the case: In its lawsuit, Dominion sought $1.6 billion in damages from Fox News. The right-wing network argued vociferously in pretrial proceedings that this number was inflated and didn’t come close to accurately capturing the potential losses that Dominion could have suffered as a result of Fox’s 2020 broadcasts.\nFox News and Fox Corporation — its parent company, which was also a defendant — say they never defamed Dominion, and say the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. They denied Dominion’s claim that they promoted these election conspiracies to save their falling ratings after the 2020 election.\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was smeared on Fox shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.\nThe Fox-Dominion trial has resumed, after an unexplained delay of more than two hours.\nThe unexplained delay in the Fox News-Dominion defamation trial has surpassed 90 minutes.\nMoments ago in court, CNN observed a top Fox lawyer showing a piece of paper —presumably a note — to a top Dominion lawyer.\nA few minutes later, they both stepped out of the courtroom, into a private, secured area for court staff. Moments later, they walked back into court together. It is not known what they privately discussed, if anything.\nThe lawyers — Fox attorney Dan Webb and Dominion attorney Justin Nelson —subsequently huddled at Dominion’s table for a few minutes, in public view. They were talking to each other, but it is not known what they are saying.\nBoth men are now sitting at their respective tables, looking at their phones.\nThis comes ahead of the expected opening statements in the $1.6 billion defamation trial against Fox News.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has formally named a special master to investigate whether Fox News withheld evidence from Dominion Voting Systems, according to court filings.\nCNN reported last week that the judge was likely to launch this inquiry, which revolves around whether Fox intentionally suppressed evidence that it was legally obligated to provide to Dominion. The dispute escalated after audiotapes emerged of Fox host Maria Bartiromo talking to Rudy Giuliani in 2020.\n“The investigation should include a determination whether Fox News Network, LLC and Fox Corporation complied with their discovery obligations,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis wrote.\nThe order, which was posted on the docket earlier in the day as jury selection began in the trial, directed attorney John Elzufon to lead the inquiry. Elzufon previously served as special master to handle routine evidentiary issues in the case.\nElzufon is required to finish his probe and submit a report by May 15.\nThe judge’s order indicates that the special master has the power to take depositions as part of his inquiry – and the special master will be allowed to depose anyone he thinks is appropriate.\nFox is required to pay for all expenses related to the investigation, according to Davis’ order.\nFox lawyers say they never withheld anything from Dominion, and that when new evidence emerged at a late stage, they turned it over as quickly as possible.\nThe court in the Dominion-Fox defamation trial reconvened as planned at 1:30 p.m. ET in Wilmington, Delaware, after a lunch break, but there has been an unexplained slowdown in the proceedings.\nThe trial has not yet moved to opening statements, though that is expected next.\nLawyers for both sides have been present in the courtroom since things reconvened about one hour ago.\nThey have been looking at their phones, talking among their colleagues and waiting.\nThe jury is not inside the courtroom.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "title": "Steve Jobs Dreamed it  Elon Musk Is Making it Frui 20250804 061426",
    "content": "For those with the foresight to act now, the potential rewards could be enormous\nKey Takeaways:\nEditor’s note: “Steve Jobs Dreamed it. Elon Musk Is Making it Fruitful.” was previously published in July 2025 with the title “Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and the Most Lucrative Invention of the Century.” It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.\nWe all know about Steve Jobs: the leadership, the turtlenecks, the gadgets he helped bring to life that went on to reshape nearly every facet of our lives – the iPhone, the Mac, the iPad.\nHe was one of the greatest innovators of our time, guiding Apple (AAPL) to become one of the most profitable companies of the century.\nBut what if I told you there’s a Steve Jobs story you’ve never heard – one that might be his most ambitious dream of all?\nIt was a vision so daring that it aimed not just to sell a new product but transform America itself; bring back prosperity, rebuild forgotten towns, and free the country from its dependence on foreign factories.\nWe’re talking about an aspiration with economy-transforming potential…\nIn the late 1980s and early ’90s, while other CEOs were shipping jobs overseas, Jobs was deeply worried.\nHe saw that America’s industrial heart was being hollowed out; that the knowledge of how to make things was leaving our shores. And he knew that, once gone, it might never come back.\nFor Jobs, manufacturing wasn’t just about assembly lines. It was about innovation. When a nation stops building, it stops inventing. It becomes dependent; vulnerable. And that terrified him.\nSo, the Apple co-founder hatched a plan. He called it his next revolution: a vision for advanced factories where human and robot workers create the future together, right here in America. He dreamed of high-paying jobs, revitalized Rust Belt towns, and a nation in control of its destiny once again.\nIn 1990, Jobs built a prototype factory in California. The idea? Use cutting-edge automation to make American workers so productive they could outcompete cheap overseas labor. Robots would handle the repetitive work while people run the show. It was genius.\nExcept the world wasn’t quite ready for this idea to be realized. The tech wasn’t there. The economics didn’t pencil out. And when Jobs passed in 2011, many thought his most audacious dream died with him…\nBut it didn’t.\nIt’s being brought to life right now, powered by technologies Jobs could only imagine during his lifetime – and driven by the one entrepreneur bold and dedicated enough to finish what he started: Elon Musk.\nThe man who made electric cars sexy, privatized space travel, and wants to put chips in your brain has taken up Jobs’ mantle – and he’s supercharging it.\nWhere Jobs had clunky robots and primitive AI, Musk has Tesla’s (TSLA) Optimus: a humanoid robot that can see, think, and move with uncanny precision. Thanks to advances in AI, sensors, and materials science, Musk has cracked the code Jobs never could.\nTesla’s gigafactories already have these robots at work, carrying parts, assembling components, and charging themselves when needed.\nAnd these aren’t million-dollar prototypes. Musk says they’ll cost under $20,000 apiece. That’s less than what some companies pay per year for offshore labor.\nOptimus does what Jobs dreamed of: makes reshoring not just patriotic but profitable.\nIn our view, this robot is a game-changer – one that could end the era of offshoring and bring manufacturing roaring back to American soil.\nImagine factories where robots do the grunt work – tirelessly, flawlessly, 24/7 – while human workers move into high-skill, high-pay roles like programming, supervising, and maintaining.\nImagine the Rust Belt reborn, with jobs flooding back and towns revitalized.\nToday, it’s more than a fantasy. It’s the plan.\nAnd the economics are undeniable… because when a robot costs less than a single offshore worker, works all day and night, and produces zero defects, why keep factories overseas?\nOptimus is actively rewriting the logic behind global supply chains. It’s no wonder politicians of all stripes are drooling over it.\nTrump’s “America First” vision now seems more like an inevitability. And this isn’t just about replacing jobs. It’s about transforming them.\nHistory shows that automation often creates more jobs. For example, when ATMs launched in the 1970s, experts worried they would eliminate bank-teller roles. But that didn’t happen. Instead, as automation lowered the cost of running branches, banks opened more of them – and teller employment rose from around 300,000 in 1970 to 600,000 by 2010.\nEconomists call this a “compensation effect.” Automation reduces unit costs, spurring demand for services and supporting new roles – especially those involving human interaction and problem-solving.\nThat’s why we expect that for every fleet of robots, we’ll need several human workers to program, maintain, and supervise them. And beyond that, there should be a ripple effect for component suppliers, software developers, infrastructure workers, and more.\nIn other words, as Tesla’s Optimus scales, we’re likely to see growing innovation hubs, supplier networks, and regional career ecosystems, rekindling the kind of job-rich rebounds seen in past industrial shifts.\nStill skeptical? Let’s talk numbers:\nAnd it’s not just Tesla that wins if that’s the case.\nEvery revolution has its ecosystem. Just as the iPhone created fortunes for component suppliers like Skyworks (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Optimus will likely mint new industrial titans as demand for chipmakers, sensor suppliers, actuator specialists, and materials innovators takes off.\nIndeed, since Optimus isn’t built from off-the-shelf parts, Tesla is creating an entirely new supply chain, from neural vision chips to exoskeleton materials.\nThat means dozens of small, specialist companies are about to go from obscure to essential.\nThink about that potential. If you’d known Apple’s supplier list before the iPhone launched, how rich would you be today?\nThat’s the opportunity on the table right now – if you act before Musk starts naming names as Optimus production scales up.\nWhy now?\nBecause we think the stars have finally aligned:\nWe have technological readiness. AI, robotics, and materials science have advanced to the point where humanoids are viable tools.\nThere’s political will, too. We have bipartisan hunger for reshoring, with Optimus seemingly offering the ultimate solution.\nAnd there is economic necessity. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of global supply chains. Now both companies and governments want control back.\nFolks, we may actually be living through the opening chapter of a story that will be told for generations.\nJobs dreamed it. Musk is building it. And for those with the foresight to act now, the potential rewards could be enormous.\nThis isn’t just a product cycle or even the birth of a new industry. It’s the dawn of a new era – one where America reclaims its industrial might, powered by intelligent robots that work alongside us.\nOptimus is already here. The only question is: will you watch this revolution unfold from the sidelines… or will you be part of it, profiting along the way?\nLearn about the high-upside firms that we think have the biggest potential amid the rise of the robots.\nBy uncovering early investments in hypergrowth industries, Luke Lango puts you on the ground-floor of world-changing megatrends.\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2025/08/steve-jobs-elon-musk-and-the-most-lucrative-invention-of-the-century/.\n©2025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\nMarket Analysis\nStocks to Buy\nHot Stocks\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nMarket Analysis\nAll rights reserved.

    "content": "Markets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nSo far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022.\nThat means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.\nNot everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\nIf you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.\nRelated article\nTaxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\nOrganize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\nIf you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\n“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\nProofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\nWhat to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\nRelated article\nYour tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\nOr the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.\nIf you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\nWhat to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\nRelated article\nYour tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\nOr the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.\nIf you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.\nAvanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.\nNetwork Rail said several lines in Scotland would be closed from 12pm on Monday, with all other routes experiencing a reduced timetable and longer journey times.\nScottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.\nIn a post on X it said: \"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\"\nMeanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.\nRod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\"\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\n\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\"\nShe added: \"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\"\nNational Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.\nStrong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.\nLast year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.\nIn 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.\nIn 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\".\nThese two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.\nAll four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.\nThe first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

    "content": "Caring for a cat with chronic health conditions can be challenging for all involved, from the process of getting to a veterinary clinic to the stress of being in a strange environment with new smells and animals.\nResearchers at the University of California, Davis, worked with pet owners across the United States and Canada to determine whether video telehealth visits could help improve care and the home environment for cats with feline degenerative joint disease, commonly referred to as feline arthritis.\nThe findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science, show that video calls where pet owners can ask questions and get non-medical advice can be beneficial. More than 95% of those who took part in the research said they would pay for telehealth visits, though most were willing to pay a little less than for in-clinic appointments.\n\"Teleadvice is meant to provide advice and support for caregivers caring for their cats,\" said lead author Grace Boone, an assistant specialist in the UC Davis Animal Welfare Epidemiology Lab. \"We found that overall everybody was quite interested in video telehealth for home management of their cats and their mobility issues.\"\nA common ailment\nRoutine veterinary care is important to prevent, mitigate and treat health and behavioral problems. And feline arthritis is quite common, present in roughly 6% to 30% of cats under age 10 and from 64% to 92% of those older than 10, Boone said.\n\"Cats are great at hiding signs of pain,\" said Carly Moody, senior author on the paper and an assistant animal science professor. \"These conditions are prevalent and pain is a serious health and welfare issue that needs to be addressed. Telehealth is beneficial because it allows you to take out that clinic stressor for some aspects of care.\"\nThe researchers recruited 106 pet owners whose cats had mobility issues. Each one filled out a questionnaire about their cat's mobility, barriers to getting in-person care and how they felt about telehealth.\nPet owners in the test group took the survey and participated in six video visits -- one every three weeks over four months -- and then retook the survey. The control group only received the questionnaire at the beginning of the research and four months later. A presentation on caring for cats with mobility issues also was offered to all participants at the end.\nIn the home video session, Boone asked general questions about the cat's wellbeing and mobility, and suggested modifications if owners asked for advice. Suggestions included elevated food and water dishes to ease neck strain, larger litter boxes with shorter walls, and additional steps to access favorite places. Pet owners reported that the visits helped them understand their cats' needs, making them more confident in how they cared for their cats.\n\"There's a lot of in-home modifications that can be implemented to increase cat comfort in the home,\" Moody said. \"Telehealth allows veterinary professionals to see and understand the cat's home environment and make recommendations which can be helpful for the cat.\"\nAdvice not medicine\nTelehealth visits don't require a veterinarian. A registered veterinary technician or other knowledgeable staff member can conduct the calls, answer questions and give advice. They are not meant to replace in-person veterinary care but rather supplement it, Moody said.\n\"There's ways you can incorporate telehealth to make it easier for the owner and the cat and increase the number of visits and support an owner is receiving, particularly when they're caring for a cat that requires chronic high levels of care at home,\" Moody said.\nThe visits have the potential to foster better veterinarian-client-patient relationships. \"Rather than being something that detracts from in-person care, I think you can improve it and help supplement it,\" Boone said.\nEvaluating changes in the home\nNext up is to determine whether recommended changes based on expert advice can improve a cat's wellbeing in the home.\n\"I think it would be really interesting to look at these interventions and specifically say, 'Are they helpful?' If somebody's not willing to change a lot of things in their home, you could prioritize the ones that make the most difference for the cat's welfare,\" Moody said.\nMoody's lab may also examine whether telehealth could be beneficial for other health issues like obesity and disease prevention.\nHao-Yu Shih from the Mayo Clinic and Daniel Pang, who is affiliated with the University of Calgary and University of Montreal in Canada, contributed to the research.

    "content": "We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesn’t feature every company or financial product available on the market, we’re proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward — and free.\nSo how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners.\nSaturdays in February can get expensive.\nMany or all of the products on this page are from partners who compensate us when you click to or take an action on their website, but this does not influence our evaluations or ratings. Our opinions are our own.\nHow is this page expert verified?\nNerdWallet's content is fact-checked for accuracy, timeliness and relevance. It undergoes a thorough review process involving writers and editors to ensure the information is as clear and complete as possible.\nLead Writer/Spokesperson\nSally French is co-host of the Smart Travel podcast and a writer on NerdWallet's travel team. Before joining NerdWallet as a travel rewards expert in 2020, she wrote about travel and credit cards for The New York Times and its sibling site, Wirecutter.\nOutside of work, she loves fitness, and she competes in both powerlifting and weightlifting (she can deadlift more than triple bodyweight). Naturally, her travels always involve a fitness component, including a week of cycling up the coastline of Vietnam and a camping trip to the Arctic Circle, where she biked over the sea ice. Other adventures have included hiking 25 miles in one day through Italy's Cinque Terre and climbing the 1,260 steps to Tiger Cave Temple in Krabi, Thailand.\nShe lives in San Francisco.\nManaging Editor\nClaire Tsosie is a managing editor for the travel rewards team at NerdWallet. She started her career on the credit cards team as a writer. Her work has been featured by Forbes, USA Today and The Associated Press.\nLet’s just say this: If you want a great deal on Walt Disney World tickets, try visiting on a Wednesday in late summer.\nNerdWallet analyzed more than 18 months’ worth of ticket data to find out the cheapest days to go to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.\nHere’s what we found:\nPrices don’t vary much by day of the week, but they vary a lot by month. Late summer has the lowest-cost tickets by far.\nBut if you’re looking for every possible opportunity to save:\nWednesdays are the cheapest day of the week to visit.\nSeptember is the cheapest month to visit.\nSummer is the cheapest season to visit.\nIn summer, Florida’s heat, humidity and hurricane risks drive down demand and ticket prices. But if you’re flexible and prepared for possible weather cancellations and delays, the savings could be worth it.\nThis analysis was done in July 2025. Prices were based on publicly available March 2025 data for adult ticket prices. The dates analyzed spanned March 2025 through October 2026, and were pulled from the official Walt Disney World website. Figures were based on a one-day ticket, though Disney offers discounts for longer stays.\nDisney prices vary by day and by park, so ticket prices were based on the cheapest park of that particular day (typically Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park). The four theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort are Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Epcot and Magic Kingdom Park.\nIn this article\nWednesday is the cheapest day of the week to go to Disney World, and Saturday is the most expensive — but the difference is small.\nWednesday tickets average just under $153, about $7 cheaper than Saturday. Still, for large groups, that could add up.\nHere’s the average ticket price by day of the week:\nDay\nAverage adult one-day ticket price\nWednesday\n$152.99.\nTuesday\n$153.82.\nThursday\n$154.30.\nMonday\n$158.52.\nFriday\n$158.81.\nSunday\n$161.58.\nSaturday\n$160.01.\nIf you’ve ever wilted in Florida’s summer heat, you won’t be surprised that late summer is the most affordable time to visit Disney World — and the data backs that up.\nSeptember is the cheapest month to visit Disney World, with an average one-day ticket price of just under $127.\nThat’s about $45 less than February, the most expensive month to visit.\nWith hurricane season peaking in late summer, consider travel insurance. Look for a policy that offers trip cancellation, trip interruption and delay coverage, and make sure it covers weather-related disruptions. If you're using a travel credit card, check whether it already includes built-in travel protections. In some cases, you may not need to buy a separate policy.\nHere’s the full breakdown by month:\nMonth\nAverage adult one-day ticket price\nSeptember\n$126.73.\nAugust\n$133.60.\nJuly\n$156.18.\nJune\n$158.25.\nMay\n$159.24.\nJanuary\n$161.58.\nOctober\n$163.19.\nNovember\n$164.67.\nDecember\n$167.39.\nApril\n$169.\nMarch\n$169.39.\nFebruary\n$172.39.\nOne benefit of visiting in August or September: You'll get Halloween vibes for less.\nBecause Halloween is one of the most popular times to visit, the park gets its spooky and festive decor by mid-August. It also hosts an after-hours, separately-ticketed event called Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party.\nYes, winter is magical with holiday decor and hot cocoa, but it’s also the priciest season by far. If you can brave the Florida heat, you’ll spend less by traveling in the summer.\nHere’s how the seasons shake out:\nSeason\nAverage adult one-day ticket price\nSummer\n$144.97.\nFall\n$159.42.\nSpring\n$162.93.\nWinter\n$168.17.\nBook off-peak days. Ticket prices for the days studied ranged from $119 to $179. The highest concentration of those $119 tickets were on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays in late August and most weeks in September, aside from Labor Day.\nMeanwhile, you’re likely to find those $179 tickets in February, when the weather in Orlando is mild.\nLook for promotions. You might also be able to save through Disney’s limited-time ticket promotions, which often expire in late summer. For example, Disney has a deal where tickets for kids ages 3 to 9 are 50% off if you book three days or longer. That offer is available through Sept. 20, 2025.\nBuy discounted tickets. You can get deals on Disney tickets by leveraging affiliations or memberships. AAA often offers discounts, and Disney also often offers military discounts. If you have credit card points, it’s sometimes possible to redeem them for Disney tickets. It’s also possible to find discount Disney tickets through third-party, authorized resellers such as Undercover Tourist.\non Undercover Tourist®'s website\non Undercover Tourist®'s website\nPros\nCons\nPros\nCons\nHave fun outside the parks. You don’t need a park ticket every day to have fun. There are all sorts of free things to do outside the parks. You can see animals at Animal Kingdom Lodge or watch fireworks from the Polynesian Village Resort beach — no hotel stay required. Disney even pipes in the music.\nYou want a travel credit card that prioritizes what’s important to you. Here are some of the best travel credit cards of 2025:\nFlexibility, point transfers and a large bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card\nNo annual fee: Wells Fargo Autograph® Card\nFlat-rate travel rewards: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card\nBonus travel rewards and high-end perks: Chase Sapphire Reserve®\nLuxury perks: The Platinum Card® from American Express\nBusiness travelers: Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card\nTable of Contents\nDownload the app\nDisclaimer: \nNerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.\n            This information may be different than what you see when you visit a\n            financial institution, service provider or specific product's\n            site.

    "title": "The Iran Israel War Is Over  But the Arab World Is 20250804 052328",
    "content": "The Iran-Israel ceasefire seems to be holding. Arab capitals are relieved about the de-escalation. But they are also alarmed about what the latest flare up means for the Middle East.\nWhen Iran signed the JCPOA nuclear deal with the Obama Administration, its reception in the Arab Gulf was, at best, frosty. The Iranian regime’s role in propping up Bashar al-Assad’s rule in Syria—one of the most devastating in modern Arab history—combined with its nefarious influence in Iraq and Lebanon, ensured that Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain saw the deal not as a diplomatic breakthrough, but as an endorsement of a destabilizing actor.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSo when President Donald Trump withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, these same states applauded the move. Others in the region, including Egypt and Jordan, while more muted, also expressed concern about Tehran’s regional agenda. Yet fast forward to the present and the very same states opposed a fight with Iran, and support re-engagement.\nThis U-Turn is not due to any newfound trust in Tehran. The Arab Gulf states, broadly speaking, remain deeply cynical about the Iranian regime. If the Islamic Republic could be replaced with something more pragmatic and less ideologically driven than Khomeini’s revolutionary doctrine, few in the Arab Gulf would mourn. But this cynicism has evolved into a pragmatic rejection of war—especially one at the behest of a belligerent Israel and a complicit Washington.\nFor these reasons, the overwhelming response in Arab capitals has been fierce opposition to Israel’s strikes, and America’s bombing on June 22.\nAdvertisement\nThere are two core reasons for this opposition. First, these strikes are not happening in isolation. Over the past 20 months, Israel has waged a deadly and destructive campaign in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which has brought about a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. Israel has also expanded its military footprint beyond the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, amid the chaos following the ouster of Assad. And it has struck Beirut and parts of Lebanon repeatedly, including within the past week.\nIn short, even among states that are highly critical of Iran, there are concerns about an unrestrained Israel. A vision of a new regional order where Israel behaves with impunity while dictating security norms to its neighbors is profoundly unwelcome to Arab states, including traditionally pro-Western Arab governments such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan.\nThe second reason is more fundamental. For decades, Arab societies have criticized the West’s selective enforcement of international norms. That includes the 2003 Iraq war, Israel’s ongoing occupation in the West Bank and Gaza, and more recently the U.S. denunciation of the ICJ case and sanctioning of ICC judges after it issued arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. There is a perception that powerful Western states shield Tel Aviv from consequences.\nAdvertisement\nRead More: The West Is Losing the Global South Over Gaza\nTo be sure, the Arab states are hardly models of legality themselves. Various U.N. reports have repeatedly described an undemocratic region rife with issues around corruption, nepotism, and closed civil society spaces. But the powerful Western countries that erected the “rules-based” order should be exemplar pillars of it—otherwise, trust in the project altogether collapses.That’s why the U.S. bombing of Iran—using the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, the heaviest non-nuclear weapon in its arsenal—set a dangerous precedent. Despite the undeniable nature of Iran being a nefarious actor in the region, there was no imminent threat, no U.N. Security Council authorization, and no widespread international consensus to engage in such a military strike.\nThe war between Iran and Israel is over, at least for now. Whether Iran’s nuclear program has been hobbled is a separate question, one that analysts and intelligence agencies will continue to assess in the weeks and months to come.\nAdvertisement\nBut something else may have also ended. A new era is emerging in the region increasingly defined by a presumption that might equals right. The consequences of this have yet to be truly understood—but there are likely to be many repercussions indeed.\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "The Making of an American Pope 20250804 052328",
    "content": "Story\nOur cover story, plus updates on Elon Musk and the Trump Administration suing L.A.\nLength:\nLong\nSpeed:\n1.0x\n“I’m ticked,” says John Prevost, the retired Midwestern high school principal who is now, abruptly and without warning, globally famous and in demand. “I didn’t want to be, but I’m so angry.” He’s sitting at the table of Denise and Rob Utter, who have invited a bunch of people from their local Catholic parish, about 45 minutes south of Chicago, to talk about their friend and John’s kid brother Bob, whom they have known for decades, over pizza. Sometimes they call him Father Bob. Occasionally they remember to call him by his new name, Pope Leo XIV, but it’s unfamiliar to their tongue. One of the guests accidentally calls him Pope Pius.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIt’s probably not all fun and games to be the spiritual leader of 1.4 billion people from very different cultures at a time when the Catholic Church is recovering from multiple scandals, riven from within, financially ensnarled, and, especially in the so-called developed nations, wrestling with a growing disinterest in the stuff it does best—ancient ritual, obligatory gathering, biblical exegesis. But it’s also a teensy bit of a drag to be his brother.\nPope Leo XIV, 69, is the person to whom lots of people look when they want to come in contact with God. John Prevost, 71, is the person to whom they look when they want to reach the Pope. His mailbox is inundated. A local accounting firm sent him a 30-page pitch deck on how it would sort out the Vatican’s finances. Another opportunist sent him two baseballs, asking for them to be forwarded to His Holiness, newly anointed as the world’s most famous White Sox fan. “Dear Mr. Prevost, please have your brother sign these baseballs,” the accompanying letter said, according to its recipient. “You can keep one and run a fundraiser.” His mail carrier is sympathetic, advising him to hire someone to handle the paper blizzard.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s not just mail. His phone (a landline) rings well into the night. One recent warm day, Prevost was watering his yard when he noticed people at his front door. It was congregants from a now shuttered church in Chicago, St. Adalbert’s. “They had a two-page letter to send to the Pope in the hopes that he will convince the Cardinal to reopen the church—and they were not going to give up,” he says. Even Hollywood is getting in on the act. Prevost has already had a showbiz publicist offer to represent him, and a journalist stop by post-interview to give him tips on what is imprudent to say on live TV—such as his imminent travel plans.\nPrevost’s travails are one of the many ripple effects of May 8, 2025, when the conclave made several types of history by handing the papal keys to a recently appointed American Cardinal. Robert Francis Prevost is not only the first Augustinian, the first modern missionary, and the first devotee of Peeps and Hostess Snoballs to occupy the Throne of St. Peter, he’s also the first leader from a land where opportunism and entrepreneurship are admired only slightly less than the triune God. America is not used to having a local guy as the driving force of an institution with four times as much history and an even greater capacity to inspire fear and awe. But a deep dive into Pope Leo’s education and background shows that either by divine intervention, wise choices, luck, or all three, his path made him uniquely prepared for steering through the choppy waters facing the ancient denomination he now leads.\nAdvertisement\nAs recently as three months ago, it was a truth universally acknowledged that there was not going to be a Pope from the U.S. anytime soon. The Americans were too dominant elsewhere, too loud, too confident, too greedy, too obsessed with individual liberties. They venerated the new and the shiny, preferring novel and homegrown faiths to the traditions of Europe or Asia. They were more concerned with LGBTQ rights and the ordination of women than the plight of the poor and dispossessed.\nBut if ever there were going to be an American Pope, people could have predicted he’d come from the Midwest. “He’s Midwestern nice,” says Father Paul Galetto, the pastor of St. Paul church in Philadelphia, of the fellow Augustinian he has known since his 20s. “He listens to you. He’s pleasant. He’s not going to jump in the middle of your conversation, tell you you’re wrong. That’s a great advantage for him.”\nAdvertisement\nEven the much prevailed-upon John Prevost can’t stay ticked for long. A few evenings before our dinner party, someone left a package at his doorstep. It was a Wordle cap. (He plays Wordle with his Vatican-based brother every day; he in English, the Pope in Italian.) “And then here comes the card: ‘Dear John, in a world where there are so many evil people right now, you are a breath of fresh air, thank you,’” says Prevost. “‘We so appreciate your sense of humor and your kind words.’ And that changed my attitude. People are watching me, so I’d better not be crabby.”\nIt was clear from very early on where the youngest of Mildred and Louis Prevost’s three sons was heading. “The only thing that was in question until eighth grade was, would it be an order priest, or would it be a diocesan priest?” says John. (The former belongs to a brotherhood, while the latter serves a church.) “Nothing was forced on him. That was his decision to make.” The family were eager Catholics: his mother, a school librarian, sang in the choir, as did young Robert. They had relatives who were nuns. Before he became a high school principal and district superintendent, Louis, who served in the Navy during World War II, had considered being a priest. His sons’ career choices mirrored their father’s: Louis, the oldest, named after his dad, went into the Navy. John was a principal of Catholic high schools. And Robert took the path his father might have taken.\nAdvertisement\nApart from his devotion to the church, and the fact that study came easily to him, Robert was a regular kid, riding his bike around the streets of the south Chicago working-class suburb of Dolton by day, playing flashlight tag by night, and occasionally squeezing the glowing goo out of fireflies and wiping it on an older brother. It didn’t seem odd that he occasionally set up a pretend Communion table on the ironing board and gave his family play sacraments. John confirms that even while very young, Robert had a reputation among the neighbors, with one elderly lady telling him as they played in the yard that he’d be Pope one day.\nAdvertisement\nWhen young men showed an inclination toward entering the priesthood in 1967 Chicago—a city that was Catholic enough that locals identified themselves by their parish rather than their neighborhood—they’d be visited by representatives of the various orders, football-scout style, to see where they might fit in. “I remember sitting around a table each time someone was coming, and they would come, and then everyone would ask questions,” says John Prevost. “We had to sit there and be nice.” The vocational director who persuaded eighth-grade Robert to give the Augustinians a spin was Dudley Day, a Catholic of the old school, whose views were conservative enough that he later parted ways with his local church over a disagreement about modernization.\nAdvertisement\nSt. Augustine, the minor seminary in Holland, Mich., where Robert Prevost completed his secondary education, was the kind of place that sorted the priests from the merely pious. About 50 boys were accepted every year, and about a dozen graduated four years later. “It was tough; it was rigorous,” says Father Becket Franks, who was the year ahead of the future Pope at school. Students were up at 6 a.m. and had scheduled activities until about 8:30 p.m., when they had a few hours of free time before retiring to a large dormitory lined with beds. They attended Mass and two other prayer services a day and had a lot of time in close quarters together.\nPrevost, who was co-valedictorian and yearbook editor among other accolades, had a reputation for being a good person to turn to for help with homework, especially math or languages. “He was the smartest person I think we ever met,” says Franks, who is now a Benedictine monk and chaplain. “He had mastered French by the middle of high school.” Students were required to undertake certain extracurricular activities (Prevost was in the choir with Franks—both sing tenor—and played tennis) and to keep up their academic performance, but mostly the school’s focus was how to live in community. “Everything that we went through at St. Augustine Seminary High School prepared Robert Prevost for his position,” says Franks. “Not just education but dealing with people and learning patience and how to behave.”\nAdvertisement\nFrom Michigan, Prevost went to Villanova, the Augustinian university just outside Philadelphia. It was in Pennsylvania that he really developed his love of driving, which according to two contemporaries, he would do while reading a book. He and three friends once asked Father Bill Sullivan, who oversaw would-be friars, if they could drive to a church dance in Chicago—some 12 hours away—and be back the following afternoon. In January. Their request was declined. “He just was an easy guy to be with,” says Sullivan, now a parochial vicar at St. Jude’s, the church the Utters belong to in New Lenox, Ill. “He made friends. People really listened to him.” Prevost majored in math and minored in philosophy, but it was pretty much the end of his study of anything not directly related to his faith. In September 1977, shortly after he finished his coursework at Villanova, he made the first round of vows to join the Augustinian order.\nAdvertisement\nAt 22, Robert Prevost was committing his life to an establishment in the midst of generational change. The Catholic Church of his parents had been altered profoundly by the Second Vatican Council, which released a series of reports in the mid-’60s, loosening up some of the church’s strictures and establishing a series of new procedures and rules that allowed, among other things, Mass to be said in languages that were not Latin and pastoral care for those who are divorced. One result of these changes was a call for a new style of urban and more ecumenical Catholic university. Prevost joined an institution founded on those principles.\nThe Catholic Theological Union (CTU), housed in the former Aragon Hotel, was a decade old when Prevost arrived. Two dozen or so men’s orders studied there, as well as women and laypeople, and the school had female professors and a rabbi on staff. What it didn’t have was any students on the way to becoming diocesan priests. (They trained in the more palatial Mundelein Seminary outside Chicago.) The mix of cultures, genders, and orders and the shedding of hierarchy—professors were called by their first names—made it an exciting place to be. “It was, in a certain sense, the best of what religious community can become,” says Sister Dianne Bergant, 88, who taught there for 45 years.\nAdvertisement\nBergant marveled at the opportunities she was given. “This is going to sound like an exaggeration, but I do not ever remember being minimized by my male colleagues because I was a woman,” she says. “Women were considered to be theologians in the same way as men.” She had Prevost in two classes, Old Testament and Pentateuch, and doesn’t remember him at all but can tell from her class notes that he did well and always turned in his assignments on time. Each student had a spiritual director, and Prevost chose Sister Lyn Osiek, who also supervised his theological-reflection class. “Calm and steady,” says Osiek. “Those are the two words that I would say about him. It was just like nothing fazed him. He was really a person who was at peace with himself.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the end of the day students from a religious order went back to the houses of their communities where professors from the order also lived and dined and prayed with them. About a dozen Augustinians lived together in the St. John Stone Friary in Hyde Park, with others coming and going. While it’s safe to say it was collegial, it was not one of the party houses. “Sometimes we were invited up to different parts of the building where the other communities were to celebrate various things,” says Prevost’s classmate Father Mark Francis, now superior general of the Viatorians. “The Passionists, for example, would always have a Kentucky Derby Day. And the Precious Blood always had kegs of beer.” Bergant confirms this: “Those Precious Blood men put on good parties.”\n(The St. John Stone Friary has been in the news over the years because a priest accused of abusing at least 13 minors was allowed to move in there in 2000. A victims’ group filed a complaint with the Vatican in March, alleging that Prevost “endangered the safety” of children by allowing the priest to live near an elementary school. “To our knowledge, Pope Leo XIV has acted in accordance with Church policies in every abuse case,” the Archdiocese of Chicago said in a statement in May, “and has consistently expressed his compassion for survivors of this crime and sin.” A lawyer for Midwest Augustinians has suggested the location was selected because of the supervision the priest would receive. The complaint also alleged that Prevost failed to properly handle three women’s claims of sexual abuse while he was bishop in Peru in 2022; the Vatican has said Prevost followed church protocol and sent the results of an initial investigation to Rome. The Vatican closed its own investigation in August 2023, though the diocese later reopened the case.)\nAdvertisement\nThe scholarship at CTU was both rigorous and progressive. One of the required classes, on Christology, had two versions, one taught by a professor trained by Edward Schillebeeckx, the respected Belgian theologian who promulgated the idea that the true role of the Christian was not to ascribe to a certain set of beliefs but to right injustice as Jesus did, and the other trained by the equally respected German theologian Karl Rahner, whose emphasis was on the mystical nature of Christ and thus of all humans.\n“We were not trained in a very doctrinaire, rigid kind of theology,” says Francis, who served a stint as CTU’s president. “One of the strengths of the school was the missiological part. The question of religion and culture was very important in terms of how we have to recalibrate things if you’re moving from one group to another, one culture to another.” Many of CTU’s graduates became missionaries, including one of Prevost’s contemporaries, Ezechiele Ramin, who was murdered in 1985 in Brazil as he tried to broker peace between the corporate landowners and the local landless farmers. There is a campaign to have him beatified.\nAdvertisement\nBishop Daniel Turley, who lived in the Augustinian friary for a few months in the late ’70s, remembers Prevost as being particularly committed to the idea of doing missionary work. In general, the Augustinians are considered a missionary order who teach and preach. St. Augustine left Europe and moved to North Africa with a handful of other devotees to live out a life saturated by their beliefs while also absorbed in the needs of their neighbors. Augustinians don’t stay in one place like the Benedictines, but move around, bringing their gifts to different places, but always among other Augustinians. The current Pope once described the order as “brothers and friends whose lives and witness truly make a difference.”\nWherever Prevost has gone, he has been among men who had been trained as he was and committed to sharing everything. Even when he was a Cardinal with his own papal apartment, he went to the Augustinian curia for meals and Mass every day, and once a week to play tennis; he dined there at least twice in the early weeks of his papacy. “He was very interested in what I was doing in Peru,” says Turley, who worked there for 52 years. While other students were heading to their rooms to study, Prevost wanted to talk about what people in Turley’s diocese needed. “Of all of them, he was the most community minded,” says Turley.\nAdvertisement\nIf Prevost spent most of his first quarter-century less than 800 miles from his home, the decades that followed would take him quite a bit farther. After he graduated from CTU and took his solemn vows in 1981, he was invited to study canon law in Rome. “Americans had stopped going to study in Rome,” says Galetto, who was one of the first to return. “We thought American theology was better, more modern. It wasn’t based on patristics, but more on psychology and sociology.” When he arrived with Robert Dodaro, his co-valedictorian from way back at high school, neither speaking Italian, Galetto was their guide. John Paul II, now St. John Paul II, had just been elected, a youngish Polish Pope emerging at the same time as Lech Walesa’s Polish trade union, Solidarity. “There was this electric feel,” says Galetto. “Large crowds were coming to the audiences.”\nWhile Prevost was studying a historic and doctrinaire subject, essentially the legal framework for the Catholic Church’s operations, at the Angelicum, a 440-year-old school where John Paul II had also studied, he was surrounded by the excitement of a new era. The Augustinian house was across St. Peter’s Square from the Vatican, and it was filled with men from around the world. Galetto remembers Prevost really enjoying the global nature of the brotherhood. “When you study in Rome, you realize that the church is really universal,” says Galetto. “Many of the Augustinians who are in the United States, we just think that the American problems are the church’s problems, but there’s so much more than that.”\nAdvertisement\nBecause of his legal expertise, Prevost was asked to become personal secretary to a bishop in Chulucanas in northern Peru. But he arrived in the aftermath of deadly El Niño floods and set to work helping rebuild the region. “When you’re a missionary, you just learn how to do everything, from electronics to auto mechanics,” said then Cardinal Prevost during a visit to St. Jude’s last year. It was not a seamless process. There might still not have been an American Pope if one of Prevost’s Augustinian brethren hadn’t saved him from being electrocuted with a well-aimed tackle on a roof after the young missionary picked up the wrong two wires.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Pope Leo owes his formal education almost solely to the northern hemisphere, much of his shaping as a practitioner occurred in Peru. “Those are the life experiences that give you life to continue on, that nourish you,” says Turley, who was Prevost’s superior when he arrived. “As a young priest, to go through that, and see how beautiful it is, how poor people can be, and yet all of the goodness and the power of people when they come together, and the wonderful things that they can do if you start breaking down prejudices and division.” Prevost said as much at St. Jude’s: “The part of ministry that most shaped my life is Peru.”\nAfter a decade in South America, it must have been quite an adjustment to take on the role of head of his home Augustinian province, which stretches throughout the Midwest and into Canada. One of his duties as provincial prior was to minister to Augustinian schools, and he was called in to help out St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago. The students have a retreat every year, and the school likes to invite priests who are unfamiliar to the boys to hear confession so they don’t feel awkward. In 2000, Prevost was one of those priests. “I had gone to confession several times before, but it was like two minutes, let me get out of here as quickly as I can,” says Patrick “PJ” McCarthy. “But this was more of just a conversation.” The two sat knee to knee in the darkened room and talked about underage drinking and sibling rivalry, among other things. “He was not judging me, and he was just very open,” recalls McCarthy. Mike Stawski, who was on the retreat as a student leader, noticed right away that Prevost was different from most priests. “What was so fascinating about him was that almost immediately, we forgot that he wasn’t with us the whole time. He was so welcoming, so caring for what we were doing.”\nAdvertisement\nAfter two years, Prevost was voted in as the head, or prior general, of all Augustinians, based again in Rome. He traveled a lot, encouraging the other 2,800 or so Augustinian friars around the world. But priors general can serve only two terms, and in 2013, Prevost found himself back in Chicago, back at CTU, helping guide Augustinians in training, work usually done by much younger men. “It’s like having the CEO of an international organization retire from being CEO, but yet be employed by the organization for passing out mail,” says Bergant, the Old Testament scholar.\nIf Prevost felt it was a comedown, he said nothing to his friends. That’s the Father Bob the folks of New Lenox talk about, never too busy or too big for his community. After Father Mike Schweifler had a heart transplant on Easter in 2005, the women of St. Jude’s who were looking after him struggled to get his brethren to visit. But Prevost, who was prior general, came several times. “Sometimes he was just on a stopover and he drove here from O’Hare for a few hours or a few minutes,” says Denise Utter. “And then he’d go back to O’Hare, because he had a connecting flight.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time Prevost’s friends want to make clear that he’s not overly reverent. He laughed when they showed him Saturday Night Live’s “Weekend Update” segment about his election on YouTube. When they get together for pizza (he favors mushroom and sausage), “we mostly don’t talk about faith-based things at all,” says Utter. Lisa Solava and her husband Rich visited Prevost in Rome in 2011, and he took them through a back door to St. Peter’s Basilica for Mass so that they emerged right under the altar. “When I walked up that spiral staircase, I looked up and I went, ‘Jesus Christ!’” recalls Solava. “And he goes, ‘That’s a good reaction.’” The current Pope also knows his way around a good clean Midwestern joke, at least according to his brother. One of the last jokes he told Pope Francis was about going to the doctor because his arm hurt in two places, says John Prevost. “And the Pope said, ‘Really? What did the doctors say?’ And Bob said, ‘Doctors told me: Don’t go to those places.’”\nAdvertisement\nPrevost’s return to Chicago also turned out to be something of a stopover, because in 2014, Francis, whom Prevost had met when the late Pontiff was still Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, asked him to return to Peru, this time as bishop of Chiclayo, a large metropolis in the north. The diocese was dominated by clerics who were members of Opus Dei, a very conservative sect of Catholicism, and Prevost, who had to become a Peruvian citizen to become a bishop, was charged with moving it back to the middle. “So you had some resistance to the new bishop,” says Turley. “But those [Opus Dei adherents] who were in control quickly lost control, because the people really wanted someone who was open and welcoming.”\nThe challenges weren’t only from within the church. “Right after he became a bishop, we had the tremendous problem of Venezuela,” says Turley, who oversaw the Catholic Church’s response to the 1.5 million asylum seekers accepted into Peru after the Venezuelan economy and civil society began to collapse in 2014. They needed housing, jobs, and medical help. “One of the best bishops to work with in dealing with migrants was none other than Bishop Robert Prevost,” says Turley. “His diocese was so well organized to take care of them.”\nAdvertisement\nThe combination of Prevost’s formal but reformist education and long fieldwork among people with very little but each other to insulate them from hardship was perhaps what drew Pope Francis to swiftly raise his standing at the Vatican as the Pontiff saw the dying of the light. In Hope, Francis’ last book, he wrote that for the church to grow, it had to focus less on conversion and more on attracting people through the way Christians lived, and therefore for high-ranking church officials, “the title of ‘servant’—here in the sense of ministry—should obscure that of ‘eminence.’”\nIn 2023, Prevost was made a Cardinal and moved back to Vatican City, working in successively more prominent roles, until the announcement of his election in May. “He’s been formed in the kind of church that is forward-thinking, missionary in its outlook, globally aware, and then, especially in Peru, very deeply formed by his accompaniment of people who were the poorest,” says Sister Barbara Reid, the current president of CTU. “You can hear it in everything he says.”\nAdvertisement\nFor many, it can be hard to believe the Catholic Church has any relevance today. All those ornate empty buildings with men in robes waving smoke around elderly congregants, preaching homilies with references to activities as quaint as shepherding and sowing, and praying to dead saints whose miracles are now forgotten or considered dubious. The first American Pope officially comes from the Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, which seems almost as fantastical as coming from the Gladden Fields of Middle Earth. The church of his childhood, St. Mary of the Assumption, is abandoned, its stained-glass windows (one displaying the papal keys) uncontemplated.\nBut every time one expression of faith dies, a new one seems to rise up offering something more in keeping with the needs of the era. History records the first Pope Leo as an adept diplomat; he’s credited with persuading Attila the Hun not to sack Rome. The current Pope Leo has already offered Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a place to negotiate. In the wake of the U.S. bombing of Iran, he urged world leaders to “stop the tragedy of war before it becomes an irreparable abyss.”\nAdvertisement\nWhen Galetto saw his fellow Augustinian step onto the balcony, he paused for a moment to reflect on the mysterious ways of the universe. “We started at the same place 40 years ago. Here I am stapling papers together at a parish because we’re having a prayer service,” he says, “and he’s going to be talking to Putin about the war in Ukraine. God had a plan for him, and God had a plan for me.”\nBob Prevost might never climb behind the wheel of a car again. But Pope Leo might be able to drive something. Already inquiries about becoming an Augustinian novitiate are up fivefold from last year. Augustinian websites have been flooded with traffic. And another type of visitor has been showing up on John Prevost’s doorstep: people who feel that an American Pope is a sign. “Because of my brother, they are going back to the church,” says the older Prevost. “They say, ‘I’ve been away for a long time. And I’d like to come back.’”\nAdvertisement\nCorrection, July 1\nThe original version of this story misspelled the last name of two of Pope Leo XIV’s friends.

Sometimes they call him Father Bob. Occasionally they remember to call him by his new name, Pope Leo XIV, but it’s unfamiliar to their tongue. One of the guests accidentally calls him Pope Pius.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIt’s probably not all fun and games to be the spiritual leader of 1.4 billion people from very different cultures at a time when the Catholic Church is recovering from multiple scandals, riven from within, financially ensnarled, and, especially in the so-called developed nations, wrestling with a growing disinterest in the stuff it does best—ancient ritual, obligatory gathering, biblical exegesis. But it’s also a teensy bit of a drag to be his brother.\nPope Leo XIV, 69, is the person to whom lots of people look when they want to come in contact with God. John Prevost, 71, is the person to whom they look when they want to reach the Pope. His mailbox is inundated. A local accounting firm sent him a 30-page pitch deck on how it would sort out the Vatican’s finances. Another opportunist sent him two baseballs, asking for them to be forwarded to His Holiness, newly anointed as the world’s most famous White Sox fan. “Dear Mr. Prevost, please have your brother sign these baseballs,” the accompanying letter said, according to its recipient. “You can keep one and run a fundraiser.” His mail carrier is sympathetic, advising him to hire someone to handle the paper blizzard.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s not just mail. His phone (a landline) rings well into the night. One recent warm day, Prevost was watering his yard when he noticed people at his front door. It was congregants from a now shuttered church in Chicago, St. Adalbert’s. “They had a two-page letter to send to the Pope in the hopes that he will convince the Cardinal to reopen the church—and they were not going to give up,” he says. Even Hollywood is getting in on the act. Prevost has already had a showbiz publicist offer to represent him, and a journalist stop by post-interview to give him tips on what is imprudent to say on live TV—such as his imminent travel plans.\nPrevost’s travails are one of the many ripple effects of May 8, 2025, when the conclave made several types of history by handing the papal keys to a recently appointed American Cardinal. Robert Francis Prevost is not only the first Augustinian, the first modern missionary, and the first devotee of Peeps and Hostess Snoballs to occupy the Throne of St. Peter, he’s also the first leader from a land where opportunism and entrepreneurship are admired only slightly less than the triune God. America is not used to having a local guy as the driving force of an institution with four times as much history and an even greater capacity to inspire fear and awe. But a deep dive into Pope Leo’s education and background shows that either by divine intervention, wise choices, luck, or all three, his path made him uniquely prepared for steering through the choppy waters facing the ancient denomination he now leads.\nAdvertisement\nAs recently as three months ago, it was a truth universally acknowledged that there was not going to be a Pope from the U.S. anytime soon. The Americans were too dominant elsewhere, too loud, too confident, too greedy, too obsessed with individual liberties. They venerated the new and the shiny, preferring novel and homegrown faiths to the traditions of Europe or Asia. They were more concerned with LGBTQ rights and the ordination of women than the plight of the poor and dispossessed.\nBut if ever there were going to be an American Pope, people could have predicted he’d come from the Midwest. “He’s Midwestern nice,” says Father Paul Galetto, the pastor of St. Paul church in Philadelphia, of the fellow Augustinian he has known since his 20s. “He listens to you. He’s pleasant. He’s not going to jump in the middle of your conversation, tell you you’re wrong. That’s a great advantage for him.”\nAdvertisement\nEven the much prevailed-upon John Prevost can’t stay ticked for long. A few evenings before our dinner party, someone left a package at his doorstep. It was a Wordle cap. (He plays Wordle with his Vatican-based brother every day; he in English, the Pope in Italian.) “And then here comes the card: ‘Dear John, in a world where there are so many evil people right now, you are a breath of fresh air, thank you,’” says Prevost. “‘We so appreciate your sense of humor and your kind words.’ And that changed my attitude. People are watching me, so I’d better not be crabby.”\nIt was clear from very early on where the youngest of Mildred and Louis Prevost’s three sons was heading. “The only thing that was in question until eighth grade was, would it be an order priest, or would it be a diocesan priest?” says John. (The former belongs to a brotherhood, while the latter serves a church.) “Nothing was forced on him. That was his decision to make.” The family were eager Catholics: his mother, a school librarian, sang in the choir, as did young Robert. They had relatives who were nuns. Before he became a high school principal and district superintendent, Louis, who served in the Navy during World War II, had considered being a priest. His sons’ career choices mirrored their father’s: Louis, the oldest, named after his dad, went into the Navy. John was a principal of Catholic high schools. And Robert took the path his father might have taken.\nAdvertisement\nApart from his devotion to the church, and the fact that study came easily to him, Robert was a regular kid, riding his bike around the streets of the south Chicago working-class suburb of Dolton by day, playing flashlight tag by night, and occasionally squeezing the glowing goo out of fireflies and wiping it on an older brother. It didn’t seem odd that he occasionally set up a pretend Communion table on the ironing board and gave his family play sacraments. John confirms that even while very young, Robert had a reputation among the neighbors, with one elderly lady telling him as they played in the yard that he’d be Pope one day.\nAdvertisement\nWhen young men showed an inclination toward entering the priesthood in 1967 Chicago—a city that was Catholic enough that locals identified themselves by their parish rather than their neighborhood—they’d be visited by representatives of the various orders, football-scout style, to see where they might fit in. “I remember sitting around a table each time someone was coming, and they would come, and then everyone would ask questions,” says John Prevost. “We had to sit there and be nice.” The vocational director who persuaded eighth-grade Robert to give the Augustinians a spin was Dudley Day, a Catholic of the old school, whose views were conservative enough that he later parted ways with his local church over a disagreement about modernization.\nAdvertisement\nSt. Augustine, the minor seminary in Holland, Mich., where Robert Prevost completed his secondary education, was the kind of place that sorted the priests from the merely pious. About 50 boys were accepted every year, and about a dozen graduated four years later. “It was tough; it was rigorous,” says Father Becket Franks, who was the year ahead of the future Pope at school. Students were up at 6 a.m. and had scheduled activities until about 8:30 p.m., when they had a few hours of free time before retiring to a large dormitory lined with beds. They attended Mass and two other prayer services a day and had a lot of time in close quarters together.\nPrevost, who was co-valedictorian and yearbook editor among other accolades, had a reputation for being a good person to turn to for help with homework, especially math or languages. “He was the smartest person I think we ever met,” says Franks, who is now a Benedictine monk and chaplain. “He had mastered French by the middle of high school.” Students were required to undertake certain extracurricular activities (Prevost was in the choir with Franks—both sing tenor—and played tennis) and to keep up their academic performance, but mostly the school’s focus was how to live in community. “Everything that we went through at St. Augustine Seminary High School prepared Robert Prevost for his position,” says Franks. “Not just education but dealing with people and learning patience and how to behave.”\nAdvertisement\nFrom Michigan, Prevost went to Villanova, the Augustinian university just outside Philadelphia. It was in Pennsylvania that he really developed his love of driving, which according to two contemporaries, he would do while reading a book. He and three friends once asked Father Bill Sullivan, who oversaw would-be friars, if they could drive to a church dance in Chicago—some 12 hours away—and be back the following afternoon. In January. Their request was declined. “He just was an easy guy to be with,” says Sullivan, now a parochial vicar at St. Jude’s, the church the Utters belong to in New Lenox, Ill. “He made friends. People really listened to him.” Prevost majored in math and minored in philosophy, but it was pretty much the end of his study of anything not directly related to his faith. In September 1977, shortly after he finished his coursework at Villanova, he made the first round of vows to join the Augustinian order.\nAdvertisement\nAt 22, Robert Prevost was committing his life to an establishment in the midst of generational change. The Catholic Church of his parents had been altered profoundly by the Second Vatican Council, which released a series of reports in the mid-’60s, loosening up some of the church’s strictures and establishing a series of new procedures and rules that allowed, among other things, Mass to be said in languages that were not Latin and pastoral care for those who are divorced. One result of these changes was a call for a new style of urban and more ecumenical Catholic university. Prevost joined an institution founded on those principles.\nThe Catholic Theological Union (CTU), housed in the former Aragon Hotel, was a decade old when Prevost arrived. Two dozen or so men’s orders studied there, as well as women and laypeople, and the school had female professors and a rabbi on staff. What it didn’t have was any students on the way to becoming diocesan priests. (They trained in the more palatial Mundelein Seminary outside Chicago.) The mix of cultures, genders, and orders and the shedding of hierarchy—professors were called by their first names—made it an exciting place to be. “It was, in a certain sense, the best of what religious community can become,” says Sister Dianne Bergant, 88, who taught there for 45 years.\nAdvertisement\nBergant marveled at the opportunities she was given. “This is going to sound like an exaggeration, but I do not ever remember being minimized by my male colleagues because I was a woman,” she says. “Women were considered to be theologians in the same way as men.” She had Prevost in two classes, Old Testament and Pentateuch, and doesn’t remember him at all but can tell from her class notes that he did well and always turned in his assignments on time. Each student had a spiritual director, and Prevost chose Sister Lyn Osiek, who also supervised his theological-reflection class. “Calm and steady,” says Osiek. “Those are the two words that I would say about him. It was just like nothing fazed him. He was really a person who was at peace with himself.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the end of the day students from a religious order went back to the houses of their communities where professors from the order also lived and dined and prayed with them. About a dozen Augustinians lived together in the St. John Stone Friary in Hyde Park, with others coming and going. While it’s safe to say it was collegial, it was not one of the party houses. “Sometimes we were invited up to different parts of the building where the other communities were to celebrate various things,” says Prevost’s classmate Father Mark Francis, now superior general of the Viatorians. “The Passionists, for example, would always have a Kentucky Derby Day. And the Precious Blood always had kegs of beer.” Bergant confirms this: “Those Precious Blood men put on good parties.”\n(The St. John Stone Friary has been in the news over the years because a priest accused of abusing at least 13 minors was allowed to move in there in 2000. A victims’ group filed a complaint with the Vatican in March, alleging that Prevost “endangered the safety” of children by allowing the priest to live near an elementary school. “To our knowledge, Pope Leo XIV has acted in accordance with Church policies in every abuse case,” the Archdiocese of Chicago said in a statement in May, “and has consistently expressed his compassion for survivors of this crime and sin.” A lawyer for Midwest Augustinians has suggested the location was selected because of the supervision the priest would receive. The complaint also alleged that Prevost failed to properly handle three women’s claims of sexual abuse while he was bishop in Peru in 2022; the Vatican has said Prevost followed church protocol and sent the results of an initial investigation to Rome. The Vatican closed its own investigation in August 2023, though the diocese later reopened the case.)\nAdvertisement\nThe scholarship at CTU was both rigorous and progressive. One of the required classes, on Christology, had two versions, one taught by a professor trained by Edward Schillebeeckx, the respected Belgian theologian who promulgated the idea that the true role of the Christian was not to ascribe to a certain set of beliefs but to right injustice as Jesus did, and the other trained by the equally respected German theologian Karl Rahner, whose emphasis was on the mystical nature of Christ and thus of all humans.\n“We were not trained in a very doctrinaire, rigid kind of theology,” says Francis, who served a stint as CTU’s president. “One of the strengths of the school was the missiological part. The question of religion and culture was very important in terms of how we have to recalibrate things if you’re moving from one group to another, one culture to another.” Many of CTU’s graduates became missionaries, including one of Prevost’s contemporaries, Ezechiele Ramin, who was murdered in 1985 in Brazil as he tried to broker peace between the corporate landowners and the local landless farmers. There is a campaign to have him beatified.\nAdvertisement\nBishop Daniel Turley, who lived in the Augustinian friary for a few months in the late ’70s, remembers Prevost as being particularly committed to the idea of doing missionary work. In general, the Augustinians are considered a missionary order who teach and preach. St. Augustine left Europe and moved to North Africa with a handful of other devotees to live out a life saturated by their beliefs while also absorbed in the needs of their neighbors. Augustinians don’t stay in one place like the Benedictines, but move around, bringing their gifts to different places, but always among other Augustinians. The current Pope once described the order as “brothers and friends whose lives and witness truly make a difference.”\nWherever Prevost has gone, he has been among men who had been trained as he was and committed to sharing everything. Even when he was a Cardinal with his own papal apartment, he went to the Augustinian curia for meals and Mass every day, and once a week to play tennis; he dined there at least twice in the early weeks of his papacy. “He was very interested in what I was doing in Peru,” says Turley, who worked there for 52 years. While other students were heading to their rooms to study, Prevost wanted to talk about what people in Turley’s diocese needed. “Of all of them, he was the most community minded,” says Turley.\nAdvertisement\nIf Prevost spent most of his first quarter-century less than 800 miles from his home, the decades that followed would take him quite a bit farther. After he graduated from CTU and took his solemn vows in 1981, he was invited to study canon law in Rome. “Americans had stopped going to study in Rome,” says Galetto, who was one of the first to return. “We thought American theology was better, more modern. It wasn’t based on patristics, but more on psychology and sociology.” When he arrived with Robert Dodaro, his co-valedictorian from way back at high school, neither speaking Italian, Galetto was their guide. John Paul II, now St. John Paul II, had just been elected, a youngish Polish Pope emerging at the same time as Lech Walesa’s Polish trade union, Solidarity. “There was this electric feel,” says Galetto. “Large crowds were coming to the audiences.”\nWhile Prevost was studying a historic and doctrinaire subject, essentially the legal framework for the Catholic Church’s operations, at the Angelicum, a 440-year-old school where John Paul II had also studied, he was surrounded by the excitement of a new era. The Augustinian house was across St. Peter’s Square from the Vatican, and it was filled with men from around the world. Galetto remembers Prevost really enjoying the global nature of the brotherhood. “When you study in Rome, you realize that the church is really universal,” says Galetto. “Many of the Augustinians who are in the United States, we just think that the American problems are the church’s problems, but there’s so much more than that.”\nAdvertisement\nBecause of his legal expertise, Prevost was asked to become personal secretary to a bishop in Chulucanas in northern Peru. But he arrived in the aftermath of deadly El Niño floods and set to work helping rebuild the region. “When you’re a missionary, you just learn how to do everything, from electronics to auto mechanics,” said then Cardinal Prevost during a visit to St. Jude’s last year. It was not a seamless process. There might still not have been an American Pope if one of Prevost’s Augustinian brethren hadn’t saved him from being electrocuted with a well-aimed tackle on a roof after the young missionary picked up the wrong two wires.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Pope Leo owes his formal education almost solely to the northern hemisphere, much of his shaping as a practitioner occurred in Peru. “Those are the life experiences that give you life to continue on, that nourish you,” says Turley, who was Prevost’s superior when he arrived. “As a young priest, to go through that, and see how beautiful it is, how poor people can be, and yet all of the goodness and the power of people when they come together, and the wonderful things that they can do if you start breaking down prejudices and division.” Prevost said as much at St. Jude’s: “The part of ministry that most shaped my life is Peru.”\nAfter a decade in South America, it must have been quite an adjustment to take on the role of head of his home Augustinian province, which stretches throughout the Midwest and into Canada. One of his duties as provincial prior was to minister to Augustinian schools, and he was called in to help out St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago. The students have a retreat every year, and the school likes to invite priests who are unfamiliar to the boys to hear confession so they don’t feel awkward. In 2000, Prevost was one of those priests. “I had gone to confession several times before, but it was like two minutes, let me get out of here as quickly as I can,” says Patrick “PJ” McCarthy. “But this was more of just a conversation.” The two sat knee to knee in the darkened room and talked about underage drinking and sibling rivalry, among other things. “He was not judging me, and he was just very open,” recalls McCarthy. Mike Stawski, who was on the retreat as a student leader, noticed right away that Prevost was different from most priests. “What was so fascinating about him was that almost immediately, we forgot that he wasn’t with us the whole time. He was so welcoming, so caring for what we were doing.”\nAdvertisement\nAfter two years, Prevost was voted in as the head, or prior general, of all Augustinians, based again in Rome. He traveled a lot, encouraging the other 2,800 or so Augustinian friars around the world. But priors general can serve only two terms, and in 2013, Prevost found himself back in Chicago, back at CTU, helping guide Augustinians in training, work usually done by much younger men. “It’s like having the CEO of an international organization retire from being CEO, but yet be employed by the organization for passing out mail,” says Bergant, the Old Testament scholar.\nIf Prevost felt it was a comedown, he said nothing to his friends. That’s the Father Bob the folks of New Lenox talk about, never too busy or too big for his community. After Father Mike Schweifler had a heart transplant on Easter in 2005, the women of St. Jude’s who were looking after him struggled to get his brethren to visit. But Prevost, who was prior general, came several times. “Sometimes he was just on a stopover and he drove here from O’Hare for a few hours or a few minutes,” says Denise Utter. “And then he’d go back to O’Hare, because he had a connecting flight.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time Prevost’s friends want to make clear that he’s not overly reverent. He laughed when they showed him Saturday Night Live’s “Weekend Update” segment about his election on YouTube. When they get together for pizza (he favors mushroom and sausage), “we mostly don’t talk about faith-based things at all,” says Utter. Lisa Solava and her husband Rich visited Prevost in Rome in 2011, and he took them through a back door to St. Peter’s Basilica for Mass so that they emerged right under the altar. “When I walked up that spiral staircase, I looked up and I went, ‘Jesus Christ!’” recalls Solava. “And he goes, ‘That’s a good reaction.’” The current Pope also knows his way around a good clean Midwestern joke, at least according to his brother. One of the last jokes he told Pope Francis was about going to the doctor because his arm hurt in two places, says John Prevost. “And the Pope said, ‘Really? What did the doctors say?’ And Bob said, ‘Doctors told me: Don’t go to those places.’”\nAdvertisement\nPrevost’s return to Chicago also turned out to be something of a stopover, because in 2014, Francis, whom Prevost had met when the late Pontiff was still Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, asked him to return to Peru, this time as bishop of Chiclayo, a large metropolis in the north. The diocese was dominated by clerics who were members of Opus Dei, a very conservative sect of Catholicism, and Prevost, who had to become a Peruvian citizen to become a bishop, was charged with moving it back to the middle. “So you had some resistance to the new bishop,” says Turley. “But those [Opus Dei adherents] who were in control quickly lost control, because the people really wanted someone who was open and welcoming.”\nThe challenges weren’t only from within the church. “Right after he became a bishop, we had the tremendous problem of Venezuela,” says Turley, who oversaw the Catholic Church’s response to the 1.5 million asylum seekers accepted into Peru after the Venezuelan economy and civil society began to collapse in 2014. They needed housing, jobs, and medical help. “One of the best bishops to work with in dealing with migrants was none other than Bishop Robert Prevost,” says Turley. “His diocese was so well organized to take care of them.”\nAdvertisement\nThe combination of Prevost’s formal but reformist education and long fieldwork among people with very little but each other to insulate them from hardship was perhaps what drew Pope Francis to swiftly raise his standing at the Vatican as the Pontiff saw the dying of the light. In Hope, Francis’ last book, he wrote that for the church to grow, it had to focus less on conversion and more on attracting people through the way Christians lived, and therefore for high-ranking church officials, “the title of ‘servant’—here in the sense of ministry—should obscure that of ‘eminence.’”\nIn 2023, Prevost was made a Cardinal and moved back to Vatican City, working in successively more prominent roles, until the announcement of his election in May. “He’s been formed in the kind of church that is forward-thinking, missionary in its outlook, globally aware, and then, especially in Peru, very deeply formed by his accompaniment of people who were the poorest,” says Sister Barbara Reid, the current president of CTU. “You can hear it in everything he says.”\nAdvertisement\nFor many, it can be hard to believe the Catholic Church has any relevance today. All those ornate empty buildings with men in robes waving smoke around elderly congregants, preaching homilies with references to activities as quaint as shepherding and sowing, and praying to dead saints whose miracles are now forgotten or considered dubious. The first American Pope officially comes from the Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, which seems almost as fantastical as coming from the Gladden Fields of Middle Earth. The church of his childhood, St. Mary of the Assumption, is abandoned, its stained-glass windows (one displaying the papal keys) uncontemplated.\nBut every time one expression of faith dies, a new one seems to rise up offering something more in keeping with the needs of the era. History records the first Pope Leo as an adept diplomat; he’s credited with persuading Attila the Hun not to sack Rome. The current Pope Leo has already offered Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a place to negotiate. In the wake of the U.S. bombing of Iran, he urged world leaders to “stop the tragedy of war before it becomes an irreparable abyss.”\nAdvertisement\nWhen Galetto saw his fellow Augustinian step onto the balcony, he paused for a moment to reflect on the mysterious ways of the universe. “We started at the same place 40 years ago. Here I am stapling papers together at a parish because we’re having a prayer service,” he says, “and he’s going to be talking to Putin about the war in Ukraine. God had a plan for him, and God had a plan for me.”\nBob Prevost might never climb behind the wheel of a car again. But Pope Leo might be able to drive something.

They were more concerned with LGBTQ rights and the ordination of women than the plight of the poor and dispossessed.\nBut if ever there were going to be an American Pope, people could have predicted he’d come from the Midwest. “He’s Midwestern nice,” says Father Paul Galetto, the pastor of St. Paul church in Philadelphia, of the fellow Augustinian he has known since his 20s. “He listens to you. He’s pleasant. He’s not going to jump in the middle of your conversation, tell you you’re wrong. That’s a great advantage for him.”\nAdvertisement\nEven the much prevailed-upon John Prevost can’t stay ticked for long. A few evenings before our dinner party, someone left a package at his doorstep. It was a Wordle cap. (He plays Wordle with his Vatican-based brother every day; he in English, the Pope in Italian.) “And then here comes the card: ‘Dear John, in a world where there are so many evil people right now, you are a breath of fresh air, thank you,’” says Prevost. “‘We so appreciate your sense of humor and your kind words.’ And that changed my attitude. People are watching me, so I’d better not be crabby.”\nIt was clear from very early on where the youngest of Mildred and Louis Prevost’s three sons was heading. “The only thing that was in question until eighth grade was, would it be an order priest, or would it be a diocesan priest?” says John. (The former belongs to a brotherhood, while the latter serves a church.) “Nothing was forced on him. That was his decision to make.” The family were eager Catholics: his mother, a school librarian, sang in the choir, as did young Robert. They had relatives who were nuns. Before he became a high school principal and district superintendent, Louis, who served in the Navy during World War II, had considered being a priest. His sons’ career choices mirrored their father’s: Louis, the oldest, named after his dad, went into the Navy. John was a principal of Catholic high schools. And Robert took the path his father might have taken.\nAdvertisement\nApart from his devotion to the church, and the fact that study came easily to him, Robert was a regular kid, riding his bike around the streets of the south Chicago working-class suburb of Dolton by day, playing flashlight tag by night, and occasionally squeezing the glowing goo out of fireflies and wiping it on an older brother. It didn’t seem odd that he occasionally set up a pretend Communion table on the ironing board and gave his family play sacraments. John confirms that even while very young, Robert had a reputation among the neighbors, with one elderly lady telling him as they played in the yard that he’d be Pope one day.\nAdvertisement\nWhen young men showed an inclination toward entering the priesthood in 1967 Chicago—a city that was Catholic enough that locals identified themselves by their parish rather than their neighborhood—they’d be visited by representatives of the various orders, football-scout style, to see where they might fit in. “I remember sitting around a table each time someone was coming, and they would come, and then everyone would ask questions,” says John Prevost. “We had to sit there and be nice.” The vocational director who persuaded eighth-grade Robert to give the Augustinians a spin was Dudley Day, a Catholic of the old school, whose views were conservative enough that he later parted ways with his local church over a disagreement about modernization.\nAdvertisement\nSt. Augustine, the minor seminary in Holland, Mich., where Robert Prevost completed his secondary education, was the kind of place that sorted the priests from the merely pious. About 50 boys were accepted every year, and about a dozen graduated four years later. “It was tough; it was rigorous,” says Father Becket Franks, who was the year ahead of the future Pope at school. Students were up at 6 a.m. and had scheduled activities until about 8:30 p.m., when they had a few hours of free time before retiring to a large dormitory lined with beds. They attended Mass and two other prayer services a day and had a lot of time in close quarters together.\nPrevost, who was co-valedictorian and yearbook editor among other accolades, had a reputation for being a good person to turn to for help with homework, especially math or languages. “He was the smartest person I think we ever met,” says Franks, who is now a Benedictine monk and chaplain. “He had mastered French by the middle of high school.” Students were required to undertake certain extracurricular activities (Prevost was in the choir with Franks—both sing tenor—and played tennis) and to keep up their academic performance, but mostly the school’s focus was how to live in community. “Everything that we went through at St. Augustine Seminary High School prepared Robert Prevost for his position,” says Franks. “Not just education but dealing with people and learning patience and how to behave.”\nAdvertisement\nFrom Michigan, Prevost went to Villanova, the Augustinian university just outside Philadelphia. It was in Pennsylvania that he really developed his love of driving, which according to two contemporaries, he would do while reading a book. He and three friends once asked Father Bill Sullivan, who oversaw would-be friars, if they could drive to a church dance in Chicago—some 12 hours away—and be back the following afternoon. In January. Their request was declined. “He just was an easy guy to be with,” says Sullivan, now a parochial vicar at St. Jude’s, the church the Utters belong to in New Lenox, Ill. “He made friends. People really listened to him.” Prevost majored in math and minored in philosophy, but it was pretty much the end of his study of anything not directly related to his faith. In September 1977, shortly after he finished his coursework at Villanova, he made the first round of vows to join the Augustinian order.\nAdvertisement\nAt 22, Robert Prevost was committing his life to an establishment in the midst of generational change. The Catholic Church of his parents had been altered profoundly by the Second Vatican Council, which released a series of reports in the mid-’60s, loosening up some of the church’s strictures and establishing a series of new procedures and rules that allowed, among other things, Mass to be said in languages that were not Latin and pastoral care for those who are divorced. One result of these changes was a call for a new style of urban and more ecumenical Catholic university. Prevost joined an institution founded on those principles.\nThe Catholic Theological Union (CTU), housed in the former Aragon Hotel, was a decade old when Prevost arrived. Two dozen or so men’s orders studied there, as well as women and laypeople, and the school had female professors and a rabbi on staff. What it didn’t have was any students on the way to becoming diocesan priests. (They trained in the more palatial Mundelein Seminary outside Chicago.) The mix of cultures, genders, and orders and the shedding of hierarchy—professors were called by their first names—made it an exciting place to be. “It was, in a certain sense, the best of what religious community can become,” says Sister Dianne Bergant, 88, who taught there for 45 years.\nAdvertisement\nBergant marveled at the opportunities she was given. “This is going to sound like an exaggeration, but I do not ever remember being minimized by my male colleagues because I was a woman,” she says. “Women were considered to be theologians in the same way as men.” She had Prevost in two classes, Old Testament and Pentateuch, and doesn’t remember him at all but can tell from her class notes that he did well and always turned in his assignments on time. Each student had a spiritual director, and Prevost chose Sister Lyn Osiek, who also supervised his theological-reflection class. “Calm and steady,” says Osiek. “Those are the two words that I would say about him. It was just like nothing fazed him. He was really a person who was at peace with himself.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the end of the day students from a religious order went back to the houses of their communities where professors from the order also lived and dined and prayed with them. About a dozen Augustinians lived together in the St. John Stone Friary in Hyde Park, with others coming and going. While it’s safe to say it was collegial, it was not one of the party houses. “Sometimes we were invited up to different parts of the building where the other communities were to celebrate various things,” says Prevost’s classmate Father Mark Francis, now superior general of the Viatorians. “The Passionists, for example, would always have a Kentucky Derby Day. And the Precious Blood always had kegs of beer.” Bergant confirms this: “Those Precious Blood men put on good parties.”\n(The St. John Stone Friary has been in the news over the years because a priest accused of abusing at least 13 minors was allowed to move in there in 2000. A victims’ group filed a complaint with the Vatican in March, alleging that Prevost “endangered the safety” of children by allowing the priest to live near an elementary school. “To our knowledge, Pope Leo XIV has acted in accordance with Church policies in every abuse case,” the Archdiocese of Chicago said in a statement in May, “and has consistently expressed his compassion for survivors of this crime and sin.” A lawyer for Midwest Augustinians has suggested the location was selected because of the supervision the priest would receive. The complaint also alleged that Prevost failed to properly handle three women’s claims of sexual abuse while he was bishop in Peru in 2022; the Vatican has said Prevost followed church protocol and sent the results of an initial investigation to Rome. The Vatican closed its own investigation in August 2023, though the diocese later reopened the case.)\nAdvertisement\nThe scholarship at CTU was both rigorous and progressive. One of the required classes, on Christology, had two versions, one taught by a professor trained by Edward Schillebeeckx, the respected Belgian theologian who promulgated the idea that the true role of the Christian was not to ascribe to a certain set of beliefs but to right injustice as Jesus did, and the other trained by the equally respected German theologian Karl Rahner, whose emphasis was on the mystical nature of Christ and thus of all humans.\n“We were not trained in a very doctrinaire, rigid kind of theology,” says Francis, who served a stint as CTU’s president. “One of the strengths of the school was the missiological part. The question of religion and culture was very important in terms of how we have to recalibrate things if you’re moving from one group to another, one culture to another.” Many of CTU’s graduates became missionaries, including one of Prevost’s contemporaries, Ezechiele Ramin, who was murdered in 1985 in Brazil as he tried to broker peace between the corporate landowners and the local landless farmers. There is a campaign to have him beatified.\nAdvertisement\nBishop Daniel Turley, who lived in the Augustinian friary for a few months in the late ’70s, remembers Prevost as being particularly committed to the idea of doing missionary work. In general, the Augustinians are considered a missionary order who teach and preach. St. Augustine left Europe and moved to North Africa with a handful of other devotees to live out a life saturated by their beliefs while also absorbed in the needs of their neighbors. Augustinians don’t stay in one place like the Benedictines, but move around, bringing their gifts to different places, but always among other Augustinians. The current Pope once described the order as “brothers and friends whose lives and witness truly make a difference.”\nWherever Prevost has gone, he has been among men who had been trained as he was and committed to sharing everything. Even when he was a Cardinal with his own papal apartment, he went to the Augustinian curia for meals and Mass every day, and once a week to play tennis; he dined there at least twice in the early weeks of his papacy. “He was very interested in what I was doing in Peru,” says Turley, who worked there for 52 years. While other students were heading to their rooms to study, Prevost wanted to talk about what people in Turley’s diocese needed. “Of all of them, he was the most community minded,” says Turley.\nAdvertisement\nIf Prevost spent most of his first quarter-century less than 800 miles from his home, the decades that followed would take him quite a bit farther. After he graduated from CTU and took his solemn vows in 1981, he was invited to study canon law in Rome. “Americans had stopped going to study in Rome,” says Galetto, who was one of the first to return. “We thought American theology was better, more modern. It wasn’t based on patristics, but more on psychology and sociology.” When he arrived with Robert Dodaro, his co-valedictorian from way back at high school, neither speaking Italian, Galetto was their guide. John Paul II, now St. John Paul II, had just been elected, a youngish Polish Pope emerging at the same time as Lech Walesa’s Polish trade union, Solidarity. “There was this electric feel,” says Galetto. “Large crowds were coming to the audiences.”\nWhile Prevost was studying a historic and doctrinaire subject, essentially the legal framework for the Catholic Church’s operations, at the Angelicum, a 440-year-old school where John Paul II had also studied, he was surrounded by the excitement of a new era. The Augustinian house was across St. Peter’s Square from the Vatican, and it was filled with men from around the world. Galetto remembers Prevost really enjoying the global nature of the brotherhood. “When you study in Rome, you realize that the church is really universal,” says Galetto. “Many of the Augustinians who are in the United States, we just think that the American problems are the church’s problems, but there’s so much more than that.”\nAdvertisement\nBecause of his legal expertise, Prevost was asked to become personal secretary to a bishop in Chulucanas in northern Peru. But he arrived in the aftermath of deadly El Niño floods and set to work helping rebuild the region. “When you’re a missionary, you just learn how to do everything, from electronics to auto mechanics,” said then Cardinal Prevost during a visit to St. Jude’s last year. It was not a seamless process. There might still not have been an American Pope if one of Prevost’s Augustinian brethren hadn’t saved him from being electrocuted with a well-aimed tackle on a roof after the young missionary picked up the wrong two wires.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Pope Leo owes his formal education almost solely to the northern hemisphere, much of his shaping as a practitioner occurred in Peru. “Those are the life experiences that give you life to continue on, that nourish you,” says Turley, who was Prevost’s superior when he arrived. “As a young priest, to go through that, and see how beautiful it is, how poor people can be, and yet all of the goodness and the power of people when they come together, and the wonderful things that they can do if you start breaking down prejudices and division.” Prevost said as much at St. Jude’s: “The part of ministry that most shaped my life is Peru.”\nAfter a decade in South America, it must have been quite an adjustment to take on the role of head of his home Augustinian province, which stretches throughout the Midwest and into Canada. One of his duties as provincial prior was to minister to Augustinian schools, and he was called in to help out St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago. The students have a retreat every year, and the school likes to invite priests who are unfamiliar to the boys to hear confession so they don’t feel awkward. In 2000, Prevost was one of those priests. “I had gone to confession several times before, but it was like two minutes, let me get out of here as quickly as I can,” says Patrick “PJ” McCarthy. “But this was more of just a conversation.” The two sat knee to knee in the darkened room and talked about underage drinking and sibling rivalry, among other things. “He was not judging me, and he was just very open,” recalls McCarthy. Mike Stawski, who was on the retreat as a student leader, noticed right away that Prevost was different from most priests. “What was so fascinating about him was that almost immediately, we forgot that he wasn’t with us the whole time. He was so welcoming, so caring for what we were doing.”\nAdvertisement\nAfter two years, Prevost was voted in as the head, or prior general, of all Augustinians, based again in Rome. He traveled a lot, encouraging the other 2,800 or so Augustinian friars around the world. But priors general can serve only two terms, and in 2013, Prevost found himself back in Chicago, back at CTU, helping guide Augustinians in training, work usually done by much younger men. “It’s like having the CEO of an international organization retire from being CEO, but yet be employed by the organization for passing out mail,” says Bergant, the Old Testament scholar.\nIf Prevost felt it was a comedown, he said nothing to his friends. That’s the Father Bob the folks of New Lenox talk about, never too busy or too big for his community. After Father Mike Schweifler had a heart transplant on Easter in 2005, the women of St. Jude’s who were looking after him struggled to get his brethren to visit. But Prevost, who was prior general, came several times. “Sometimes he was just on a stopover and he drove here from O’Hare for a few hours or a few minutes,” says Denise Utter. “And then he’d go back to O’Hare, because he had a connecting flight.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time Prevost’s friends want to make clear that he’s not overly reverent. He laughed when they showed him Saturday Night Live’s “Weekend Update” segment about his election on YouTube. When they get together for pizza (he favors mushroom and sausage), “we mostly don’t talk about faith-based things at all,” says Utter. Lisa Solava and her husband Rich visited Prevost in Rome in 2011, and he took them through a back door to St. Peter’s Basilica for Mass so that they emerged right under the altar. “When I walked up that spiral staircase, I looked up and I went, ‘Jesus Christ!’” recalls Solava. “And he goes, ‘That’s a good reaction.’” The current Pope also knows his way around a good clean Midwestern joke, at least according to his brother. One of the last jokes he told Pope Francis was about going to the doctor because his arm hurt in two places, says John Prevost. “And the Pope said, ‘Really? What did the doctors say?’ And Bob said, ‘Doctors told me: Don’t go to those places.’”\nAdvertisement\nPrevost’s return to Chicago also turned out to be something of a stopover, because in 2014, Francis, whom Prevost had met when the late Pontiff was still Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, asked him to return to Peru, this time as bishop of Chiclayo, a large metropolis in the north. The diocese was dominated by clerics who were members of Opus Dei, a very conservative sect of Catholicism, and Prevost, who had to become a Peruvian citizen to become a bishop, was charged with moving it back to the middle. “So you had some resistance to the new bishop,” says Turley. “But those [Opus Dei adherents] who were in control quickly lost control, because the people really wanted someone who was open and welcoming.”\nThe challenges weren’t only from within the church. “Right after he became a bishop, we had the tremendous problem of Venezuela,” says Turley, who oversaw the Catholic Church’s response to the 1.5 million asylum seekers accepted into Peru after the Venezuelan economy and civil society began to collapse in 2014. They needed housing, jobs, and medical help. “One of the best bishops to work with in dealing with migrants was none other than Bishop Robert Prevost,” says Turley. “His diocese was so well organized to take care of them.”\nAdvertisement\nThe combination of Prevost’s formal but reformist education and long fieldwork among people with very little but each other to insulate them from hardship was perhaps what drew Pope Francis to swiftly raise his standing at the Vatican as the Pontiff saw the dying of the light. In Hope, Francis’ last book, he wrote that for the church to grow, it had to focus less on conversion and more on attracting people through the way Christians lived, and therefore for high-ranking church officials, “the title of ‘servant’—here in the sense of ministry—should obscure that of ‘eminence.’”\nIn 2023, Prevost was made a Cardinal and moved back to Vatican City, working in successively more prominent roles, until the announcement of his election in May. “He’s been formed in the kind of church that is forward-thinking, missionary in its outlook, globally aware, and then, especially in Peru, very deeply formed by his accompaniment of people who were the poorest,” says Sister Barbara Reid, the current president of CTU. “You can hear it in everything he says.”\nAdvertisement\nFor many, it can be hard to believe the Catholic Church has any relevance today. All those ornate empty buildings with men in robes waving smoke around elderly congregants, preaching homilies with references to activities as quaint as shepherding and sowing, and praying to dead saints whose miracles are now forgotten or considered dubious. The first American Pope officially comes from the Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, which seems almost as fantastical as coming from the Gladden Fields of Middle Earth. The church of his childhood, St. Mary of the Assumption, is abandoned, its stained-glass windows (one displaying the papal keys) uncontemplated.\nBut every time one expression of faith dies, a new one seems to rise up offering something more in keeping with the needs of the era. History records the first Pope Leo as an adept diplomat; he’s credited with persuading Attila the Hun not to sack Rome. The current Pope Leo has already offered Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a place to negotiate. In the wake of the U.S. bombing of Iran, he urged world leaders to “stop the tragedy of war before it becomes an irreparable abyss.”\nAdvertisement\nWhen Galetto saw his fellow Augustinian step onto the balcony, he paused for a moment to reflect on the mysterious ways of the universe. “We started at the same place 40 years ago. Here I am stapling papers together at a parish because we’re having a prayer service,” he says, “and he’s going to be talking to Putin about the war in Ukraine. God had a plan for him, and God had a plan for me.”\nBob Prevost might never climb behind the wheel of a car again. But Pope Leo might be able to drive something. Already inquiries about becoming an Augustinian novitiate are up fivefold from last year. Augustinian websites have been flooded with traffic. And another type of visitor has been showing up on John Prevost’s doorstep: people who feel that an American Pope is a sign. “Because of my brother, they are going back to the church,” says the older Prevost. “They say, ‘I’ve been away for a long time. And I’d like to come back.’”\nAdvertisement\nCorrection, July 1\nThe original version of this story misspelled the last name of two of Pope Leo XIV’s friends. It is Solava, not Salva.\nCorrection, July 2\nThe original version of this story misstated how often students at St. Augustine Seminary High School gathered for Mass, as well as the years Becket Franks attended the high school. Along with two other prayer services, Mass was held once a day, not three times. Franks was one year ahead of Robert Prevost, not one year behind.\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Are you ready for a move?\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\nIt’s been said that only two things in life are certain: Death and taxes. So, when choosing where to retire in the U.S., state taxes may come to mind.\nWhile some states have no income taxes, they may have high tax rates in other areas, like sales tax, for example. Knowing a state’s tax landscape (and not just its taxes on retirement income) might give you a better sense of where to save on taxes as a retiree.\nAnd there’s one state that might fit the bill for a “tax-friendly” retirement. Here it is.\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\nTo determine the “most tax-friendly state for retirees,” Kiplinger first ranked each state based on two key factors.\nFirst, only states that don’t tax retirement benefits were chosen. Of those 13 states, the one with the lowest median property taxes paid was selected. Property tax bills were based on the most recent 5-year estimate available from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nNote: No matter where you move, federal income taxes still apply.\nMississippi.\nMany forms of retirement income are exempt from Mississippi taxes, making it the most tax-friendly state for retirement.\nA few examples of tax-exempt income in the Hospitality State include:\nNote: Early or excess withdrawals from retirement accounts may still be taxable.\nIf you receive other types of income, you’ll still pay a flat income tax of 4.4% over $10,000. But that’ll soon change.\nMississippi’s income tax rate is due for a reduction in 2026 to just 4%.\nPlus, Mississippi has no estate or inheritance tax, meaning you could pass on more wealth to your heirs.\nWhen you combine that with the state’s overall low median property tax bill of just $1,189 (compared to the national average), you can see how Mississippi earned its ranking as the most tax-friendly U.S. state for retirement.\nAnd there may be one more special tax rule that sweetens the pot.\nYou may stop paying property taxes in Mississippi at a certain age. How? Well, that depends on your property’s value. Mississippi has a homestead exemption if you meet certain eligibility requirements:\nThe total benefit of the Mississippi “senior homestead exemption” is $7,500 of assessed value. This means if your property has a value of $75,000 or less, you may be completely exempt from paying property taxes.\nHowever, like all states, there may be a few tax drawbacks to retiring in Mississippi.\nLet’s explore a few.\nAlthough Mississippi has some low taxes compared to other states, there are a few areas where the Hospitality State may be less tax-friendly for retirees. For instance:\nDespite potentially higher sales taxes on food and other essentials, Mississippi is one of the states with the lowest gas taxes.\nSo, if you enjoy going for a Sunday drive, you may take advantage of the state’s gas tax rate.\nOf course, before you’re ready for retirement in Mississippi, there are other important factors to consider.\nWhile Kiplinger’s ranking considered state tax burdens, you may want to research other key considerations, like cost of living, political climate, and crime rates, before deciding to move.\nOverall, it’s important to consider your unique financial and lifestyle needs if considering a move in retirement.\nEven though Mississippi is the most tax-friendly state for retiring, it may (or may not be) the most retirement-friendly state for you.\nProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.
