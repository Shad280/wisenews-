Nedbank Group Ltd. plans to sell its stake in a pan-African lender as the company narrows its focus on businesses in the Southern African Development Community and East Africa regions.
The South African lender will sell its 21.2% stake in Togo-based Ecobank Transnational Inc., marking the end of a 17-year strategic alliance that enabled Nedbank to expand its footprint beyond southern Africa.
