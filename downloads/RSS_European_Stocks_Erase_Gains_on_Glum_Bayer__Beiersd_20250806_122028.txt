European stocks were muted on Wednesday following a slate of underwhelming results including from Bayer AG and Beiersdorf AG.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was down 0.1% by 11:53 a.m. in London after earlier gaining as much as 0.4%. Health care was the biggest laggard, with Bayer falling 5.1% on disappointing revenue for soybean seeds and pesticides. Energy outperformed as oil ticked higher after a four-day drop.
