Multiple robots deployed across the city to drain flooded locations on day when Observatory records heaviest daily rainfall for August since 1884
Hong Kong authorities have deployed for the first time three “mobile powerful pumping robots” to drain at least 24 flooded locations on a day when the city’s forecaster recorded the heaviest daily rainfall for August since 1884.
According to the Drainage Services Department, multiple pumping robots, including three known as “water-pumping dragons” in Chinese, tackled the floods on Tuesday in Pok Fu Lam, Mid-Levels, Admiralty, Kwun Tong, Sha Tin, Sai Kung, Tai Po, Tolo Harbour, Tsuen Wan, and Yuen Long.
The “water-pumping dragons” operated either in or near the flooded area. They pumped water through a tube measuring about 30cm (one foot) in diameter, passing through the robot and into the nearest storm drain.
Department director Ringo Mok Wing-cheong on Monday said authorities had recently acquired two more “water-pumping dragons” after earlier purchasing one in April and being impressed by its capacity. Each can pump 800 cubic metres (28,250 cubic feet) of water an hour.
The one bought in April was part of four robots, including three that were not “water-pumping dragons”, that have a combined pumping capacity of 2,500 cubic metres an hour – about the volume of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. They were acquired for a total of about HK$3 million (US$386,844).
According to the department, the robots are smaller and more mobile than traditional pumping machines. They can be used to drain water from roads, villages and underground facilities.
