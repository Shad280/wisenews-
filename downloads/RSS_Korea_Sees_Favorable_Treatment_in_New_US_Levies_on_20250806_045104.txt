South Korea’s finance minister said the country has secured a commitment from the US that it won’t face less favorable treatment than any other nation if Washington pushes ahead with new tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
“The US made a commitment to give us top-tier treatment to sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors,” Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol told lawmakers during a parliamentary committee hearing Wednesday. “We’re not completely satisfied, but it’s still meaningful that Korea won’t be at a disadvantage compared to other countries.”
