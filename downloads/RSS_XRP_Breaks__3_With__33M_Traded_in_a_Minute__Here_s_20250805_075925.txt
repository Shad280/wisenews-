XRP surged to $3.05 during a volatile 24-hour period, posting a 4.45% gain from $2.92 as traders reacted to unprecedented minute-level volumes and whale liquidations.
A $33 million spike in volume was recorded within a single minute, marking one of the largest such spikes for the token.
Despite technical resistance at $3.09 and short-term sell signals flashing, machine-learning forecasts continue to target upside toward $3.12 by month-end.
What to Know
News Background
The price spike followed a broader risk-on move in crypto markets as traders rotated out of lower-cap altcoins and into high-liquidity majors.
However, on-chain data revealed aggressive sell-side flows from whale addresses and smart money funds—raising concerns that the rally may have been driven by short-term positioning ahead of regulatory catalysts.
The SEC is expected to clarify XRP’s securities treatment by mid-August, a potential binary event for the token.
