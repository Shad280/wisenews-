Trump’s Tariffs:
Vietnam’s exports jumped more than expected in July, with buyers racing to avoid a 20% tariff on the country’s exports to the US set to take effect on Aug. 7.
Exports rose 16% in July from a year earlier to $42.3 billion, the statistics office said in a statement, beating expectations of 14% growth. Imports rose 17.8% in the period to $40 billion, more than the 15.2% forecast. The trade surplus was $2.27 billion, versus $2.83 billion released in June.
