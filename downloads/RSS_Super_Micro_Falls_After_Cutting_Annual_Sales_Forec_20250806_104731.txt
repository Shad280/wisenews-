Super Micro Computer Inc. shares plunged after the company lowered its fiscal-year revenue forecast and projected quarterly profit that fell short of estimates, raising questions about sales and pricing pressures around powerful AI servers.
Revenue in the year ending in June 2026 will be at least $33 billion, Super Micro said Tuesday in a statementBloomberg Terminal. In February, the company offered a bullish long-term outlook because of demand for AI products with Nvidia Corp.’s chips, saying sales would be $40 billion — then almost twice as much as analysts’ estimates for the current fiscal year.
