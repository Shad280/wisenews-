Claims from Tuesday's black rainstorm are much worse than Typhoon Wipha, but less than those from the 2023 black rainstorm, Zurich Insurance’s Greater China CEO says
This week’s record-breaking deluge may rank among Hong Kong’s costliest natural disasters for insurers, as the owners of cars and properties started to submit claims for damages caused by 11 hours of the highest category of rainstorm.
“We received many claims from car owners due to flooding,” Hui said. “There are also claims from homeowners who suffered losses from the heavy rain.”
Hong Kong received 358.8mm (14 inches) of rainfall on Tuesday, the heaviest precipitation in August since the Hong Kong Observatory began keeping records in 1884. The most severe category of rainstorm warning was in place for 11 hours, second only to the one issued on September 7, 2023, which lasted for 16 hours and 35 minutes.
The downpours triggered 29 floods that were categorised as “significant” and caused 15 landslides in areas such as Tseung Kwan O, Central, the Western District, and Tai Po, with floodwater-submerged vehicles and damage to shops and property across the city.
