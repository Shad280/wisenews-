The most recent of the five-part series to be broadcast on the Chinese mainland shows rapid switch from training drill to simulated full-scale assault
The episode, which appeared online on Monday, depicts a “cold start” operation that involves units transitioning directly from a training drill to a simulated full-scale assault. It appears to include footage of previous live-fire exercises around Taiwan.
Paratroopers can be seen penetrating enemy lines to guide precision strikes, while infiltrating frogmen seize key infrastructure and amphibious armoured units conduct ship-borne sea transits.
The episode also features unmanned combat formations breaching beachheads after initial firepower suppression, and joint forces executing maritime blockades and area denial operations – all relevant to any amphibious operation across the Taiwan Strait.
Beijing regards Taiwan as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the United States, do not recognise the island as independent but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take it by force and is committed to supplying Taipei with arms.
