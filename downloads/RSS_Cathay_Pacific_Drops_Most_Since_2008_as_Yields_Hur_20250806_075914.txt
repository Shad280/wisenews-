Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. shares tumbled the most in almost 17 years as a sharper-than-expected decline in passenger yields and swelling expenses clouds its growth outlook.
Shares dropped as much as 11% in Hong Kong after the release of its first-half results, the most since November 2008. The stock is still up about 14% this year.
