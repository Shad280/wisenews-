Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. met in New Delhi on Tuesday and agreed to deepen their military partnership, at a time when China is becoming increasingly assertive in the Indian Ocean.
“We have agreed to continue leveling up our collaboration in defense and security,” Marcos said at a briefing in New Delhi, adding that the “expanding capabilities and footprint” of India’s domestic defense manufacturing industry would support the Philippines’ ongoing military modernization.
