Trump’s Tariffs:
US President Donald Trump’s tariff shock on India is complicating the central bank’s interest rate decision Wednesday, with some economists bringing forward their expectations for easing.
Before Trump’s announcement, most economists had expected no change in rates following the governor’s cautious stance in the June policy meeting. The majority — 23 out of 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg — still expect the Reserve Bank of India to hold this week, but a few banks have changed their forecasts recently.
