Trump’s Tariffs:
Narendra Modi has been urging Indians to buy local goods to offset any slump in global demand.
India is racing to contain the economic fallout from President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs, which has left officials in New Delhi feeling shocked, jilted and unsure of how to respond.
Trump’s harsh language — calling India’s economy “dead,” its tariff barriers “obnoxious” and its people indifferent to the plight of Ukrainians — has been akin to a verbal slap in the face, according to an official in New Delhi, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. Officials have no template to deal with these kinds of public assaults, the person said, adding that the latest turn of events has put a strain on India’s relationship with the US.
