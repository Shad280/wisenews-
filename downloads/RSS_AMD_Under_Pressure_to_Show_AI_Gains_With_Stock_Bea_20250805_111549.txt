Chip Wars:
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. earnings are expected to show the chipmaker is increasingly benefiting from the artificial intelligence arms race. The question is whether it’s enough to justify a rally that has outpaced Nvidia Corp.’s performance this year.
AMD is the top-performing chipmaker, with shares up 46% in 2025, as companies spend increasing amounts on AI computing gear. Nvidia, which dominates the market for accelerators used to run and develop AI services, has gained 34%. AMD’s outperformance of its much larger rival suggests high expectations from semiconductor investors at a time when they’ve been hard to impress.
