Lawmakers and union leaders say residents confused about whether they should have headed to work during Tuesday’s torrential rain
The Hong Kong government is under mounting pressure to clarify circumstances that warrant an “extreme conditions” announcement to prevent residents from commuting to work during hazardous weather, a day after record-breaking downpours wreaked havoc across the city.
Some lawmakers and labour union leaders called for further clarification on Wednesday after some residents expressed confusion as to whether they should have headed to work during the torrential downpours.
The highest-level black rainstorm warning was in effect for more than 11 hours on Tuesday, as the poor weather triggered flash floods and landslides.
The government said the declaration of “extreme conditions” would be considered when a natural disaster brought about extreme and widespread impacts. It gave the examples of large-scale power outages, widespread flooding, severe landslides and serious disruption to public transport services.
“The government will consider making an ‘extreme conditions’ announcement based on the actual conditions and those affecting the effective resumption of work by residents, the extent and scale of the disruption,” a government spokesman said on Wednesday.
“[This is] to allow general employees to remain in safe places after the cancellation of the No 8 tropical cyclone warning signal or the black rainstorm warning signal, rather than immediately returning to workplaces.”
