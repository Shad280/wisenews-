Oil inched higher after a five-day drop — the longest losing run since May — as investors tracked US efforts to punish buyers of Russian crude, and a diplomatic push by President Donald Trump to end the Ukraine war.
Brent rose above $67 a barrel, paring a fraction of the 8.7% loss seen in the prior five sessions, while West Texas Intermediate was near $65. On Wednesday, Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50% due to the nation’s purchases of Russian energy, with implementation to begin in three weeks. Still, there’s been no similar US move against China, another major importer of Moscow’s oil.
