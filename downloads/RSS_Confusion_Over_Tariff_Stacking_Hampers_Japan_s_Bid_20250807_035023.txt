Trump’s Tariffs:
A fresh discrepancy in interpretations of the US-Japan trade deal came to the fore on Thursday, as Japan’s chief negotiator visits Washington to press for follow-through on a pledge to cut a levy on car imports to 15%.
Japanese media reports said Washington would not exempt Tokyo from an order stacking new 15% across-the board tariffs on top of existing levies, hours before they come into effect. Japan’s top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa had earlier disputed such an understanding.
