The session between both leaders is set to yield only a broad agreement to elevate the bilateral alliance into a ‘comprehensive strategic alliance’
US representatives have reportedly informed Seoul during working-level talks that Washington does not plan to raise the Taiwan issue at the summit, according to Yonhap News Agency.
Instead, the summit was likely to yield only a broad agreement to elevate the bilateral alliance into a “comprehensive strategic alliance” in response to an evolving regional security environment, it said.
The progressive Hankyoreh daily, citing a senior government official, also reported that South Korea’s role in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would not be broached at the summit. “That is a hypothetical situation, so we will not talk about it,” the official said.
