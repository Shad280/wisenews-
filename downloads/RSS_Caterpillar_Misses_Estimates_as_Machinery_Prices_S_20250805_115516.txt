Caterpillar Inc. reported second-quarter profit that missed analysts’ expectations amid slightly lower prices for selling the company’s iconic yellow diggers and bulldozers.
The heavy equipment maker posted adjusted earnings of $4.72 a share, falling short of the $4.88 median estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Caterpillar is seen as a bellwether to the health of the global economy because its equipment is used for construction, mining, energy and transportation on every continent.
