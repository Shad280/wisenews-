Bitcoin BTC$116,345.31 rose to the highest this month, touching $116,430 and establishing itself more firmly above the $115,000 level on renewed demand for risk assets as the implications from Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs market data sink in.
The Federal Reserve is now widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, with the CME’s FedWatch tool weighing a 93.4% chance of that happening. On Polymarket, traders are slightly less convinced, seeing a 79% chance of a cut. Traders are positioning for reductions at the following two meetings as well.
Add in strong earnings from major companies and a weakening U.S. dollar, and the outlook is looking a little stronger for equities and other risk assets. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.65% today, the Euro Stoxx 50 is up 1.2% and the S&P 500 closed up 0.73% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.2% on news of chip tariff exemptions and President Trump signaling he may appoint dovish members to the Fed.
In a sign of long-term institutional interest, the State of Michigan Retirement System (SMRS) said boosted its bitcoin exposure through spot ETFs in the second quarter.
Yet the real story may be how little BTC is moving. The cryptocurrency’s 30-day implied volatility, as tracked by the BVIV index from Volmex, has dropped to 36.5%, a level not seen since October 2023, when bitcoin traded under $30,000.
The pattern resembles Wall Street's bull markets, where implied volatility tends to shrink as optimism grows. In previous cycles, bitcoin's price and volatility moved in tandem.
Structured crypto projects that allow investors to sell out-of-the-money call options to generate yield may be playing a part in reducing the volatility.
Still, geopolitical risk isn't going to go away. Trump levied an additional 25% tariff on India over its Russian oil purchases, which could lead to a “mini crunch in supplies if Delhi draws on other crude sources instead,” Hargreaves Lansdown said in an emailed note. That would likely force OPEC+ members to amp up production to avoid a crisis, Hargreaves Lansdown said.
On top of that, while peace talks on Ukraine have been advancing, recent nuclear rhetoric suggests there’s a long way to go. Stay alert!
