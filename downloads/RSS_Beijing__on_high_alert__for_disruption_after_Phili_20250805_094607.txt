On Monday, AFP chief of staff General Romeo Brawner Jnr told local media that “several” Chinese vessels had been spotted during the patrols, according to the Manila Bulletin.
“We didn’t experience any untoward incidents, but there were still some vessels that shadowed us. We expected that already,” he said, adding that he hoped the joint patrol would allow more joint activities between Manila and Delhi.
