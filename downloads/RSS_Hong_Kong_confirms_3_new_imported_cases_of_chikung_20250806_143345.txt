Hong Kong confirmed three new cases of chikungunya fever on Wednesday, comprising a woman returning from Guangdong province’s Foshan and a father and son who had travelled to Bangladesh.
The Centre for Health Protection on Wednesday said that it was investigating the three imported cases.
Health authorities said the woman, 79, lived in Southern district and had visited the mainland Chinese city of Foshan from July 1 to 31 to see her relatives.
The patient was unable to recall being bitten by a mosquito, but developed a fever and joint pain on Monday and sought treatment at Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam the next day, the centre said.
The other two cases are a 55-year-old man with a chronic disease and his 10-year-old son, who both live in Kwai Tsing district. The pair travelled to Bangladesh between July 12 and August 3.
The father first developed symptoms in Bangladesh on July 27 and visited a clinic in Hong Kong on August 4.
