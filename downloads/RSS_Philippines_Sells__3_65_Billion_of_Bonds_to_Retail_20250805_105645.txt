The Philippines sold 210 billion pesos ($3.65 billion) of treasury bonds to individual investors Tuesday, utilizing a key funding source to plug its budget gap.
It accepted more than half of the 354 billion pesos bids in a retail bonds auction Tuesday, the Bureau of the Treasury announced. The five-year bond, which comes with an offer to exchange eligible holdings with the new issue, was priced at a coupon of 6%. The bonds will be offered to the general public through Aug. 15.
