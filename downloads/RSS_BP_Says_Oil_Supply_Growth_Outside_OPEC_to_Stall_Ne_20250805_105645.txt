Oil supply growth from non-OPEC producers will stall in early 2026, while demand remains robust, according to BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Murray Auchincloss.
“Non-OPEC supply we largely see going flat after February or March next year,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday after the company reported earnings. “Supply will be relatively flat for the next 12-18 months after that.”
