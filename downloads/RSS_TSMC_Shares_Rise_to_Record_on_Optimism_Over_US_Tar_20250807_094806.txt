Taiwan said its leading chip manufacturer will not have to pay a 100% tariff on sales to the US, helping drive Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares to a record.
“TSMC is exempted from the chip tariffs because it has set up plants in the US,” Liu Chin-ching, minister in charge of the National Development Council, said in Taipei on Thursday. As for other Taiwanese companies that may be affected by the levies, they “shall continue to stay ahead” if competitors face the same charges.
