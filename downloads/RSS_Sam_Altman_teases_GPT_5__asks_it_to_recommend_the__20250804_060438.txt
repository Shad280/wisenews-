OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a screenshot on X on Sunday that appeared to be the much-anticipated GPT-5.
Altman posted a seemingly innocuous comment on X praising the animated sci-fi show "Pantheon." The show is a cult favorite in tech circles and tackles themes like artificial general intelligence.
In response, one X user asked if GPT-5 also recommends the show. Altman responded with a screenshot and said, "turns out yes!"

It is one of the first public glimpses of GPT-5, which is expected to be more powerful than earlier models, feature a larger context window, be able to take on more agentic tasks, and have multimodal capabilities.
According to the screenshot, some things will remain the same, however, like ChatGPT's love of the em dash.
OpenAI is under pressure to unveil a flashy new model as competitors like Google Deepmind, Meta, xAI, and Anthropic continue to nip at its heels.
The screenshot shows that GPT-5 is capable, at the very least, of accurately synthesizing information from the internet. The bot said Pantheon has a "100% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes" and is "cerebral, emotional, and philosophically intense."
Business Insider confirmed that it does have a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews of the show on the site use similar language. One review described it as "gripping, cerebral, remarkably high-concept." Another called it "a portrait of a rapidly changing world that takes care to document the emotional carnage left in its wake."
