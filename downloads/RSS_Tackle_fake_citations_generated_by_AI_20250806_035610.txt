As an editor and associate editor of several journals, I have observed an increase in references generated by artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models over the past two years. These fake citations can propagate through scientific literature, decreasing the reliability of published research (N. T. Camp et al. J. Academic Librarianship 51, 103065; 2025). A coordinated effort across stakeholders is needed to combat the issue.
